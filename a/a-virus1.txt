 Following is the text of the announcement that appeared on the
 VMSHARE teleconference the evening of Dec. 14, 1989.

 Append on 12/14/89 at 06:48 by Jeff Gribbin - Rolls-Royce Plc:

 A number of Rolls-Royce personnel have been the target of a mailshot
 containing a diskette and documentation which is reproduced in full
 below. if you follow the supplied instructions the program trashes
 your "C" drive.  A few phone calls indicates that this is not merely
 a few people at Rolls-Royce who've been targetted - whoever is behind
 this has spent a lot of money on it.  We've not lost anything
 ourselves (yet), but the packaging makes this look very much like the
 kind of demo diskette that we all receive weekly if not daily.  It's
 clearly designed to encourage you to use the package (although indeed
 the so-called "License Agreement" is very cleverly worded) and will
 certainly catc h the naive and the hurried.  Please warn yuor
 friends.

 If anyone has an address for "PC Cyborg Ltd" please be wary of
 publishing it a s you may thereby become an accessory before the
 fact to a case of killing by physical dismemberment ...

 ===== following is the text that accompanies the diskette =========

                    AIDS Information - Introductory Diskete

 Please find enclosed a computer diskette containing health
 information on the disease AIDS.  The information is provided in the
 form of an interactive computer program.  It is easy to use.  Here
 is how it works:
 * The program provides you with information about AIDS and asks you
   questions.
 * The program then provides you with a confidential report on your
   risk of exposure to AIDS.
 * The program provides recommendations to you, based on the life
   history information that you have provided, about practical steps
   that you can take to reduce your risk of getting AIDS.
 * The program gives you the opportunity to make comments and ask
   questions that you may have about AIDS.
 * This program is designed specially to help members of the public
   who are concerned about AIDS and medical professionals.

 Instructions This software is designed for use with IBM PC/XT
 microcomputers and with all other truly compatable microcomputers.
 Your computer must have a hard disk drive C, MS-DOS version 2.0 or
 higher, and a minimum of 256K RAM.  First read and assent to the
 limited warranty and to the license agreement on the reverse.  (If
 you use this diskette, you will have to pay the mandatory software
 leasing fee(s).) Then do the following:
 Step 1: Start your computer (with diskette drive A empty)
 Step 2: Once the computer is running, insert the Introductory
         Diskette into drive A.
 Step 3: At the C> prompt of your root directory type: A:INSTALL and
         then press ENTER.  Installation proceeds automatically from
         that point.  It takes only a few minutes.
 Step 4: When the installation is completed, you will be given easy
         to follow messsages by the computer.  Respond accordingly.
 Step 5: When you want to use the program, type the word AIDS at the

 Comments: To: VALERT-L@ibm1.cc.lehigh.edu
 Subject:      Major Trojan Warning

 This is an urgent forward from John McAfee:

 A distribution diskette from a corporation calling itself PC Cyborg
 has been widely distributed to major corporations and PC user groups
 around the world and the diskette contains a highly destructive
 trojan.  The Chase Manhattan Bank and ICL Computers were the first
 to report problems with the software.  All systems that ran the
 enclosed programs had all data on the hard disks destroyed.
 Hundreds of systems were affected.  Other reports have come in from
 user groups, small businesses and individuals with similar problems.
 The professionally prepared documentation that comes with the
 diskette purports that the software provides a data base of AIDS
 information.  The flyer heading reads - "AIDS Information - An
 Introductory Diskette".  The license agreement on the back of the
 same flyer reads:

 "In case of breach of license, PC Cyborg Corporation reserves the
 right to use program mechanisms to ensure termination of the use of
 these programs.  These program mechanisms will adversely affect
 other program applications on microcomputers.  You are hereby
 advised of the most serious consequences of your failure to abide by
 the terms of this license agreement."

 Further in the license is the sentence: "Warning: Do not use these
 programs unless you are prepared to pay for them".

 If the software is installed using the included INSTALL program, the
 first thing that the program does is print out an invoice for the
 software.  Then, whenever the system is re-booted, or powered down
 and then re-booted from the hard disk, the system self destructs.

 Whoever has perpetrated this monstrosity has gone to a great deal of
 time, and more expense, and they have clearly perpetrated the
 largest single targeting of destructive code yet reported.  The
 mailings are professionally done, and the style of the mailing
 labels indicate the lists were purchased from professional mailing
 organizations.  The estimated costs for printing, diskette, label
 and mailing is over $3.00 per package.  The volume of reports imply
 that many thousands may have been mailed.  In addition, the British
 magazine "PC Business World" has included a copy of the diskette
 with its most recent publication - another expensive avenue of
 distribution.  The only indication of who the perpetrator(s) may be
 is the address on the invoice to which they ask that $378.00 be
 mailed:

           PC Cyborg Corporation
           P.O. Box 871744
           Panama 7, Panama

 Needless to say, a check for a registered PC Cyborg Corporation in
 Panama turned up negative.

 An additional note of interest in the license section reads: "PC
 Cyborg Corporation does not authorize you to distribute or use these
 programs in the United States of America.  If you have any doubt
 about your willingness or ability to meet the terms of this license
 agreement or if you are not prepared to pay all amounts due to PC
 Cyborg Corporation, then do not use these programs".

               AIDS INFORMATION DISK
               =====================

 The latest on this is as follows:

 If you have run this disk contact ROBERT WALCZY at PC Business World
 on 01-831 9252 they have a FREE disk that combats the effects of the
 disk and they will send a copy to users effected.

 Either call Robert of FAX him on 01-405 2347 with your name and
 address.

 The disk should be available in the next day or two.

 The program will be available on CONNECT (01-863 6646) for download
 as soon as it has been tested.

 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 The AIDS disk when installed creates a number of hidden files and
 directories.  You can remove these files by running the program
 mentioned above or by using the Norton Utilities, PC Tools or
 equivalent program.

 The files that are hidden include a new AUTOEXEC.BAT and a number of
 other files and directories that contain characters that can not be
 accessed by standard DOS commands.  You will need to rename the
 files/ directories before they can be deleted.

 This information will be updated as we learn more about the disk.

                    AIDS INFORMATION DISK
                    =====================

 Update 2  13-Dec-1989 6pm

 IF you have not run this disk DO NOT INSTALL it appears to be a very
 cleverly written TROJAN program that can be activated by a number of
 methods.  Currently the activation method that has been detected
 uses a counter of the number of system reboots.  When the counter
 gets to 90 the system goes into a second phase and encrypts files
 and directories on your hard disk.

 The program appears to have a number of embelisments that makes one
 think that the front door we have been shown MAY not be the only
 method that the system uses for deciding when to activate.  This is
 a very nasty program and the only 100% safe thing to do is to backup
 all DATA files and perform a full reformat of your hard disk.

 Followed by a reinstallation of all DATA, from your backup, and
 programs from original system disks (or backup prior to installing
 this software).

 This should only be attempeted once at least TWO copies of all
 valuable data have been extracted from the system.  Please remember
 to boot your system off an original DOS disk before starting this
 procedure.

 Full details of the suggested procedure will be posted tomorrow.

 Alan Jay

 Readers who do not wish to follow this route may be interested to in
 the folowing information about the primary activation system.

 1)  A hidden 'ACTOEXEC.BAT' file contains

 CD \
 REM

    it then runs your AUTOEXEC.BAT which the program renamed AUTO.BAT

 2) A hidden subdirectory  contains a file REM.EXE

 Each time the system is booted the program is run and the counter
 incremented/decremented.  After 90 activations the system enters
 phase TWO.

 Please note that the system uses the  character 'hi space'
 in the file names to stop standard DOS procedures acting on these
 files.

 IT MAY be possible to delete these entries and thereby disable the
 program this is NOT certain and it will take several months to
 discover if this is a safe course of events to take.

 I hope that this information helps.  I also understand that this is
 in the hands of the Fraud Squad / Computer Crime Division of the
 Metropolitan Police.  If you have any further information I am sure
 that they would be interested to here from you.
