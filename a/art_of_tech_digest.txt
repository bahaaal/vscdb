Welcome to the first issue of Art of Technology Digest!!
AoT Digest is an open forum dedicated to sharing information among
computerists and to the presentation and debate of diverse views.
AoT-D material may be reprinted as long as the source is cited.
Some authors do copyright their material, and they should be contacted
for reprint permission.  It is assumed that non-personal mail at the
moderators may be reprinted unless otherwise specified.  Readers are
encouraged to submit reasoned articles relating to computer culture
and communication.  Articles are preferred to short responses.
The idea (and the format and one of the articles) of AoT Digest
is from Cu-Digest. Anyways this newsletter is for discussion of
the computer underground. It is NOT a hack/phreak newsletter, just
a rip-off of CuD with different information. Make a new file base and you're
set. I want to make this a weekly newsletter but since it's very small now,
expect something each few weeks or so.  Many of the things you should expect
to find are CPSR press releases and various other Usenet articles and responses 
from our readers.  Hmm.. I am also hoping to make a newsgroup for AoT Digest
but I can't find the FAQ response. "Frequently Asked Question: Where do I get
the response from the 'how to start a newsgroup' FAQ???".  You may also be
wondering what I moderate.  Well, I assemble the whole thing, take out any
high-ASCII and replace it with normal ASCII and put in references.  Words
in the articles are not changed.  We REALLY want responses, either posted
on Live Wire (See DISTRIBUTION in the beginning for the phone number) or
E-Mailed to me (ccappuc@caticsuf.cati.CSUFresno.EDU).  If you have anything
to say, PLEASE respond!

Subject: Article 2--Are You a Hacker? (CuD #4.33 Reprint)

[[ED: I will try not to have CuD reprints but this was a good article]]

                          ARE YOU A HACKER?
                          by Robert Bickford

Are you a Hacker?  How would you know?  If all you know about the word
is what you've seen on the evening news, or read in a magazine, you're
probably feeling indignant at the very question!  But do those
magazine-selling headlines really describe what a Hacker is?

Some time ago (MicroTimes, December 1986) I defined a Hacker as "Any
person who derives joy from discovering ways to circumvent
limitations." The definition has been widely quoted since that time,
but unfortunately has yet to make the evening news in the way that a
teenager who robs a bank with his telephone does.

Does that teenaged criminal fit my definition?  Possibly.  Does that
fact make all, or even most, Hackers criminals?  (Does that fact make
all or most Hackers teenagers?)  Of course not!  So why is there such
widespread misinformation about Hackers?  Very simply, it's because
the criminal hackers, or 'Crackers', have been making news, while the
rest of us are virtually invisible.  For every irresponsible fool
writing a virus program, there are at least twenty software engineers
earning a living "...discovering ways to circumvent limitations."
When the much-publicized InterNet worm was released by an
irresponsible hacker, hundreds of other Hackers applied their
considerable talents to the control and eradication of the problem:
the brilliance and creativity brought to this task are typical of the
kind of people --- Hackers ---that my definition is meant to describe.

Working on the yearly Hackers Conferences has been a mixed experience:
on the one hand, helping to bring together 200 of the most brilliant
people alive today, and then interacting with them for an entire
weekend, is immensely rewarding.  On the other hand, trying to explain
to others that the Hackers Conference is not a Gathering of Nefarious
Criminals out to Wreak Havoc upon Western Civilization does get a bit
wearing at times.  Also, trying to convince a caller that repeatedly
crashing his school district's computer from a pay phone will not,
emphatically not, qualify him for an invitation to the conference can
be a bit annoying.  None of this would be a problem if we hadn't let a
small minority --- the Crackers --- steal the show, and become
associated with the word 'Hacker' in the minds of the general public.
The attendees at the Hackers Conferences --- many of whom hold PhDs,
and/or are Presidents or other upper management of Fortune 500
companies --- are (quite understandably) very indignant at being
confused with these Crackers.

Taking myself as an example --- no, I don't have a PhD, my only degree
is from the School of Hard Knocks, and no, I'm not working in
management ---when this article was first published [1989] I was
writing software for a company that builds medical image processing
equipment.  My code controls a product that can, and often does,
either improve the quality of medical care, reduce the cost, or both.
When I develop a piece of software that goes around some limit I feel
very happy, and can often find myself with a silly grin plastered
across my face.  When some ignorant reporter writes a story that
equates the work I do with expensive but childish pranks committed by
someone calling himself a "Hacker", I see red.

Are you a Hacker?  If you want to break rules just for the sake of
breaking rules, or if you just want to hurt or "take revenge" upon
somebody or some company, then forget it.  But if you delight in your
work, almost to the point of being a workaholic, you just might be.
If finding the solution to a problem can be not just satisfying but
almost an ecstatic experience, you probably are.  If you sometimes
take on problems just for the sake of finding the solution (and that
ecstatic experience that comes with it), then you almost certainly
are.  Congratulations!  You're in good company, with virtually every
inventor whose name appears in your high school history book, and with
the many thousands of brilliant people who have created the "computer
revolution."

What can we do about all that bad press?  Meet it head on!  Tell the
people you work with that you're a Hacker, and what that means.  If
you know somebody whose work habits, style, or personality make them
pretty clearly a Hacker, tell them so and tell them what you mean by
that.  Show them this article!

Meanwhile, have fun finding those solutions, circumventing those
limitations, and making this a better world thereby.  You are an
Artist of Technology, a Rider of the Third Wave, and at least you can
enjoy the ride!

Bob Bickford is a software consultant who lives in Marin County, often
Hacking late into the night, and (usually) enjoying it immensely.  His
wife, Greta, only tolerates this because she's an animation hacker and
sometimes does the same thing.  Bob can be reached through InterNet at

Subject: Article 3--New! 386BSD Release 0.1!

[[ED: This is edited notes from the installation docs and distribution list
      Remember that 386BSD is a FREE operating system, if you have a 386/486
      and 50 megs to spare, I strongly recommend that you get this. At the
      end is the list of anonymous FTP sites to get 386BSD. Have fun!!]]

     Welcome to 386BSD Release 0.1, the second  edition  of
the  386BSD  operating  system  created by William and Lynne
Jolitz. Like its predecessor, 386BSD  Release  0.0,  Release
0.1  comprises  an  entire  and complete UNIX-like operating
system for the 80386/80486-based AT Personal Computer.

     386BSD Release 0.1 is an enhanced version of the origi-
nal  release  done  by  William F. Jolitz, the developer of
386BSD. 386BSD Release  0.0  was  based on  the  Networking
Software,  Release  2  from  the University of California at
Berkeley EECS Department, and included much  of the  386BSD
work  done  earlier  by Bill  and  contributed by us to the
University.  The latest release, 386BSD Release  0.1,   con-
tains  new  work  by  the developer and many new items which
have been freely contributed by other   software  developers
for  incorporation  into 386BSD (see the file CONTRIB.LIST).
These contributions have  increased  the  functionality and
made  it more robust.

     386BSD is intended for  research,  development,  educa-
tion,  and just plain exploration. Source, Binary, Installa-
tion, and Fix-It floppies are available at a large number of
sites.  There are many user groups, support groups, computer
societies and individuals  who  are  supplying  and  running
386BSD and they are good sources of information and support.

     386BSD Release 0.1 is intended to  be  widely  used  by
those  interested in "pushing the envelope" towards the for-
mation and development of innovative ideas in computer tech-
nology. As such, we have spent considerable time developing
a system which  is  simple  to  partition  and  install and
emphasizes stability and completeness.


     Among the many new features of 386BSD (from release 0.0):


*    New "Tiny 386BSD" System Installation Floppy

*    Simplified installation procedures.

*    386BSD partitioning for use on an MS-DOS system.

*    Compressed,    multivolume CPIO     dump     format
     binary/source/other  distribution  sets on MS-DOS flop-
     pies.

*    387 emulation.

*    SCSI support.

*    CD-ROM support.

*    NFS, TCP/IP and full networking.

*    New 386BSD "Fix-It" System Maintenance Floppy.

*    New "Additional User Software" MS-DOS floppy dump.

                        Free UNIX for the 386
The current version of linux is a 0.96c, released 92.07.04.  There is a
0.96 rootdisk that should be used with the new versions: it fixes a lot
of things with the old rootdisks and contains more programs due to the
shared libraries.  Patch 2 to 0.96c was released 92.07.18, and
implemented the msdos filesystem as well as correcting some problems
with the IRQ code.
0.96c supports X11r5 and the new gcc-2.1 (and newer) libraries with
multiple shared libs - as well as any old binaries (except the 0.12
version of gdb which used the older ptrace() interface).  0.96c also
contains support for debugging (core-dumping and attach/detach) as well
as profiling (use gcc-2.2.2 for the profiling code)
Linux can be gotten by anonymous ftp from 'nic.funet.fi' (128.214.6.100)
in the directory '/pub/OS/Linux'.  This directory structure contains all
the linux OS- and library-sources, and enough binaries to get going.  To
install linux you still need to know something about unices: it's
relatively straightforward to install, but the documentation sucks raw
eggs, and people with no previous unix experience are going to get very
confused.
There are now a lot of other sites keeping linux archives. Some of them
are:
    tsx-11.mit.edu (18.172.1.2):
        directory /pub/linux
    banjo.concert.net (192.101.21.6):
        directory /pub/Linux
    yagi.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp (130.34.222.67)
    
(and many additional sites: there are now sites in the uk, japan etc
that carry linux, but I have lost count)
There is also a mailing list set up 'Linux-activists@niksula.hut.fi'.
To join, mail a request to 'Linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi'.
It's no use mailing me: I have no actual contact with the mailing-list
(other than being on it, naturally).
There is also a newsgroup that contain linux-related questions and
information: comp.os.linux.
Mail me for more info:

        Pietarinkatu 2 A 2
        00140 Helsinki
        Finland
0.96c.pl2 has these new features (relative to unpatched 0.96c)
 - select() through the VFS routines
 - faster and more general sleep/wakeup routines
 - easily installable IRQ's
 - bus-mouse driver
 - msdos filesystem
0.96c has these new features (relative to 0.96b)
 - alpha-testing code of the extended filesystem
 - serial line changes (changeable irq's etc)
 - pty/console fixes.

   system.   Select  ONLY the  ones you  or your  users are  interested in.
   Aside from the three required subs (see ! above), that's all you need to
   carry, and you can always add in more subs in the future.

        If you're interested,  call Infinite Darkness.   3O5-525-4722,  all

Subject: Article 6--Sysop Arrested For Selling Porno Files To Juveniles
 
             **SYSOP ARRESTED FOR PORNO FILES TO JUVENILES**
                 Mark Lehrer, sysop of AKRON ANOMALY BBS
 
 
         MUNROE FALLS OH, July 21, 1992.  Munroe Falls Police Chief
    Steve Stahl knows computers are big with kids these days, but he
    never thought he'd see the day when a healthy 15-year-old boy would
    choose a floppy disk over a Playboy centerfold.
 
         But now that Stahl's seen some of the floppy disks popular
    with local youths, he understands the fascination.
 
         "Give me any kid, I know what he's going to download," Stahl
    said.

         In May, Munroe Falls Police received a complaint from a
    resident who feared that a local computerized community BBS
    containing sexually explicit material might be accessible to
    children.
 
         Stahl said the resident showed him files called "Alison" and
    "amber," both of which featured naked women.  He told the concerned
    resident, "Oh, well, I can see how that would be upsetting."
 
         For the past two months, police conducted an investigation and
    sting using a local 15-year-old boy.  After the youth was able to
    hook into the BBS, police arrested Mark Lehrer, 22, owner and
    operator of AKRON ANOMALY, a 1000 member BBS.  POLICE ALSO SEIZED
    ALL OF LEHRER'S COMPUTER EQUIPMENT.
 
         Lehrer is accused of distributing graphic sexual material via
    a computer modem from the Munroe Falls home of his parents, David and
    Susan Lehrer.  His father, also a computer professional, is chairman of
    the Village's Charter Review Commission.  Mark has been charged in
    Cuyahoga Falls Municipal Court with one count each of disseminating
    matter harmful to juveniles and possession of criminal tools - in this
    case, his computer and graphic files.
 
         A preliminary hearing is scheduled for July 21, 1992.  The
    case will probably be turned over to a Summit County Grand Jury,
    which means potential indictment for a felony and, if convicted,
    over a year in state prison.
 
         Chief Stahl said this will be the first case in northeast Ohio
    and one of the first in the state, in which an adult is accused of
    distributing graphic sexual materials *to juveniles* via a
    computer.
 
         "There's not a whole lot of case law on this kind of this," he
    said, adding that most material comes from books, magazines or
    movies.
 
         According to Stahl, members of AKRON ANOMALY paid $15 to $30
    a year to call the board, giving access to games like chess,
    basketball, euchre, programming instructions and *.GIF files -
    (G)raphic (I)nterface (F)iles, that feature pictures from James
    Bond to Capt. Kirk to Scooby-Doo.
 
         Some are labeled specifically for adults and are not supposed
    to be accessible to those under 18, while many others are contained
    in a general directory.  However, when police seized Lehrer's
    records, they found that even the "clean" files contained images
    "not entirely wholesome."
 
         "One was Bugs Bunny eating a carrot, one was Bart Simpson
    riding a skateboard, and one was called (a slang term for oral sex)
    and that was in the 'clean' file," Stahl said.
 
         Stahl said many files not listed in the "adult" category
    contained pictures of naked women and of naked women engaging in
    sexual acts.  One file allegedly shows a nude image of Christina
    Applegate, who plays "Kelly" on the TV show "Married with Chil-
    dren."
 
         "Parents are happy their kids are upstairs using their
    computers.  The one parent we talked to was thrilled they weren't
    finding PLAYBOY magazine.  Well, I've got news for you, this is a
    rude awakening," Stahl said.
 
         In addition to the "graphic still images," juveniles were able
    to access adult movies, which are shown on computer monitors.
    "It's like watching cable TV.  It's a very clear picture," Stahl
    said.
 
         Stahl said computer experts with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal
    Identification and Investigation are reviewing the hundreds of
    computer files seized from Lehrer's home.  Stahl said it's possible
    that some of the games and movies are being accessed in violation
    of copyright laws.
 
         "I'm not saying it's obscene because I'm not getting into that
    battle, but it's certainly not appropriate for kids, especially
    without parental permission," Stahl said.

Subject: Article 7--CPSR Recommends NREN Privacy Principles

PRESS RELEASE

July 24, 1992

CPSR Recommends NREN Privacy Principles


WASHINGTON, DC -- Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
(CPSR), a national public interest organization, has recommended
privacy guidelines for the nation's computer network.

At a hearing this week before the National Commission on Library and
Information Science, CPSR recommended a privacy policy for the National
Research and Education Network or "NREN." Marc Rotenberg, Washington
Director of CPSR, said "We hope this proposal will get the ball rolling.
The failure to develop a good policy for the computer network could be
very costly in the long term."

The National Commission is currently reviewing comments for a report to
the Office of Science and Technology Policy on the future of the NREN.

Mr. Rotenberg said there are several reasons that the Commission should
address the privacy issue.  "First, the move toward commercialization of
the network is certain to exacerbate privacy concerns.  Second, current
law does not do a very good job of protecting computer messages.  Third,
technology won't solve all the problems."

The CPSR principles are (1) protect confidentiality, (2) identify
privacy implications in new services, (3) limit collection of personal
data, (4) restrict transfer of personal information,(5) do not charge
for routine privacy protection, (6) incorporate technical safeguards,
(7) develop appropriate security policies, and (8) create an
enforcement mechanism.

Professor David Flaherty, an expert in telecommunications privacy law,
said "The CPSR principles fit squarely in the middle of similar efforts
in other countries to promote network services.  This looks like a good
approach."

Evan Hendricks, the chair of the United States Privacy Council and
editor of Privacy Times, said that the United States is "behind the
curve" on privacy and needs to catch up with other countries who are
already developing privacy guidelines.  "The Europeans are racing
forward, and we've been left with dust on our face."

The CPSR privacy guidelines are similar to a set of principles developed
almost 20 years ago called The Code of Fair Information practices.
The Code was developed by a government task force that included policy
makers, privacy experts, and computer scientists.  The Code later became
the basis of the United States Privacy Act.

Dr. Ronni Rosenberg, who has studied the role of computer scientists in
public policy, said that "Computer professionals have an important role
to play in privacy policy. The CPSR privacy guidelines are another
example of how scientists can contribute to public policy."

From: Gary Chapman 
Subject: Article 8--DNA databanking

Today (7/28) the Wall Street Journal features an article (page B1) on
DNA databanking, the FBI's computer database of DNA data, and the
concerns of critics.  The article reports that fifteen states now have
DNA databanking programs, and it is estimated that double that number
will have such programs in place by 1995.  There have been 600 trials
using DNA as evidence since 1988.  Next year the FBI is scheduled to
link state programs in a nation-wide computer network.

The article describes the first "cold search" of DNA databanks, in a
Minnesota case in which a defendant was arrested for the rape and murder
of a Minneapolis woman on the basis of a DNA match appearing in the
state's computerized system.  The crime-scene DNA was acquired from a
sperm sample and it matched a sample collected from a convicted sex
offender when he was a prisoner.

Last week the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, the highest court in
the state, ruled that DNA matching may not be used as conclusive
prosecutorial evidence in a criminal trial, although the lack of a match
can be used as a defense.  Massachusetts is the only state in the
country that has produced such a court ruling -- all of the other 40
appellate court rulings have been in favor of using DNA evidence in
support of the prosecution's case.  The Massachusetts court said that
there is insufficient scientific consensus on the validity of DNA
matching.  The court cited a recent report by the National Research
Council, which said that the state of the art leaves the technology open
to doubt.  But this could change in the future, and the Massachusetts
ruling does not rule out DNA evidence if the technology generates a
tighter scientific consensus.

Nachama Wilker, executive director of the Council for Responsible
Genetics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, says that the collection of DNA
samples from all prisoners is a slippery slope that will affect the use
of DNA in non-criminal social transactions, such as eligibility for
insurance, employment opportunity, and other forms of discrimination.
She says in The Wall Street Journal that there are no guarantees that
DNA data collected from prisoners will be used exclusively for criminal
justice procedures, and she argues that DNA evidence should only be used
for serious crimes with demonstrated patterns of repeated offenses.
Some states have passed legislation protecting the confidentiality of
DNA data, such as Wisconsin, which prohibits DNA data from being used
for insurance eligibility or employment evaluation.  Only five states
have such laws on the books, however.  Some public interest advocates
are supporting a DNA Identification Bill in the Congress, already passed
by the House, that would enforce confidentiality, limit the use of DNA
data, and impose federal standards on state laboratories.  The NRC
report also called for laboratory accreditation by federal agencies.

GATEWAY/WINDO Action Notice:

ALERT! ALERT! ALERT!

The Congress is running out of time to consider S. 2813, the GPO
Gateway to Government, and H.R. 2772, the GPO Wide Information
Network for Data Online (WINDO), legislation this year. These
bills would provide for single point on-line access to government
information through the Government Printing Office (GPO).

The House Committee on Administration and the Senate Committee on
Rules and Administration will likely meet to mark up these bills
before the scheduled August 13 congressional recess.

It is critical that members of these committees, and their
staffs, hear from supporters of the legislation over the next two
weeks if these bills are to pass the Congress this year.

Phone calls to members and their staff are most needed, but
written letters are appropriate as well.  All communication
should emphasize the need for expanded public access to federal
data bases and the simple and efficient good government approach
incorporated in these two bills.

Members of congress can be reached by phone through the Capitol
switchboard at 202/224-3121.  Mail to Senators should be
addressed:  The Honorable ______, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC

Subject: Article 3--Jerusalem virus part 2 (CVP)
Date: 23 Jul 92 23:50:00 GMT

HISVIR4.CVP   920714
 
                   The "Jerusalem" virus - part 2
 
The history of the Jerusalem virus is every bit as convoluted as its
functionality and family.  The naming alone is a fairly bizarre tale. 
As mentioned before, it was originally called the Israeli virus. 
Although considered unfair by some, it was fairly natural as the
virus had both been discovered and reported from Israel.  (Although
the virus was reported to slow down systems that were infected, it
seems to have been the "continual growth" of EXE files which led to
the detection of the virus.)  In an effort to avoid anti-semitism, it
was referred to by its "infective length" of 1813 bytes.  For COM
files.  For EXE files it was 1808 bytes.  Sometimes.  It varies
because of the requirement that the header of an EXE file is
divisible by 16.  (All quite clear?)
 
One of the early infections was found to be in an office belonging to
the Israeli Defence Forces.  This fact was reported in an Associated
Press article, and, of course, made much of.  It also gave rise to
another alias, the I.D.F. virus.
 
When the virus was first discovered, it was strongly felt that it had
been circulating prior to November of 1987.  The "payload" of file
deletion on Friday the 13th gave rise to conjecture as to why the
logic bomb had not "gone off" on Friday, November 13th, 1987. 
(Subsequent analysis has shown that the virus will activate the
payload only if the year is not 1987.)  The next following "Friday
the 13th" was May 13th, 1988.  Since the last day that Palestine
existed as a nation was May 13th, 1948 it was felt that this might
have been an act of political terrorism.  This led to another alias,
the PLO virus.  (The fact that Israel celebrates its holidays
according to the Jewish calendar, and that the independence
celebrations were slated for three weeks before May 13th in 1988 were
disregarded.  The internal structure of the virus, and the existence
of the sURIV viral programs seems to indicate that any political
correspondence is merely coincidence.)
 
Yet another alias is "sUMsDos", based upon text found in the virus
code itself.  This was, on occasion, corrupted to "sumDOS".
 
The name "Jerusalem" has gained ascendancy, possibly due to the
McAfee SCAN program identification.  (He certainly must be
responsible for the "B" designation for the "original" version.)  Of
course, the great number of variants have not helped any.  Because a
number of the variants are very closely based upon each others code,
the signatures for one variant will often match another, thus
generating even more naming confusion.  This confusion is not unique
to the Jerusalem family, of course, and is an ongoing concern in the
virus research community.

Date: Sun, 2 Aug 1992 14:18:41 1992
Subject: Article 4--2600 Announcement

The summer issue of 2600 has been released. Subscribers should
have it no later than the early part of next week. Included
within is the latest on Bellcore's lawsuit threat against us,
as well as a complete guide to the different kinds of
telephone signalling systems used throughout the world
(written by a real heavyweight in the phone phreak world),
a review of the Dutch demon dialer, a tutorial on "portable
hacking", tips on defeating call return (*69), a guide to
voice mail hacking, plus letters, news updates, revelations
of an interesting nature (more Bellcore stuff) plus a whole
lot more.

On Friday, August 7th, we'll be having meetings in six American
cities. We expect all of these meetings to continue on a
monthly basis. Please spread the word. NEW YORK: Citicorp
Center (between Lexington and 3rd) downstairs in the lobby
by the payphones. Payphone numbers: 212-223-9011, 212-223-8927,
212-308-8044, 212-308-8162. WASHINGTON DC: Pentagon City mall.
CHICAGO: Century Mall, 2828 Clark St, lower level, by the
payphones. Payphone numbers: 312-929-2695, 2875, 2685, 2994,
3287. ST. LOUIS: At the Galleria, Highway 40 and Brentwood,
lower level, food court area, by the theaters. LOS ANGELES: At
the Union Station, corner of Macy St. and Alameda. Inside main
entrance by bank of phones. Payphone numbers: 213-972-9358, 9388,
9506, 9519, 9520, 213-625-9923, 9924, 213-614-9849, 9872,
9918, 9926. SAN FRANCISCO: 4 Embarcadero Plaza (inside).
Payphone numbers: 415-398-9803,4,5,6.

There is no agenda at a 2600 meeting, no formalities of any
kind, no dress code (except maybe in St. Louis), and no
constraints other than common sense. People generally get
together, trade information, meet people, look for feds, and
do whatever else comes to mind (all legally, of course).
Each meeting runs approximately from 5 pm to 8 pm local time
on the first Friday of the month. Anyone wanting to organize
a meeting in another city should contact 2600 at our office:
(516) 751-2600.

Our voice mail system is now a voice bulletin board system
every night beginning at 11 pm Eastern time. You can reach
it at 0700-751-2600 through AT&T. If you're using another
long distance carrier, preface that number with 10288.
It costs 15 cents a minute and all of the money goes to AT&T.
Whoopee.

Subject: Article 5--Encrypted Communications
Date: 29 Jul 92 16:20:06 GMT

In general, I think laws making encrypted communications illegal 
are wasteful, stupid and oppressive, for the following reasons:

1)  They would be a violation of free speech rights.
2)  They would be a waste of time and effort, since 
  determining violation can be impossible.

3)  They would be a further waste of time and effort, 
  since such laws are impossible to enforce.

4)  They would allow a government to apply enforcement
  selectively, singling out a few (for arbitrary
  reasons) and prosecuting them under the vague
  suspicion that some communication contained en-
  crypted matter.

Point 1) seems self-evident to me.

Regarding Points 2) - 4):

A few examples and demonstrations come to mind.  One of the
most interesting and illuminating is the old 'Bacon cipher' 
controversy:  the notion that Shakespeare's folios contained 
subtle typeface variations that amounted to an encipherment 
of text written by Francis Bacon, text which indicated that 
Bacon was actually the author of the Shakespeare plays.

As I remember it, there was a heated scholarly controversy 
over this idea for many years, which had all the earmarks of 
crankdom making an assault on basic literary understanding.  
Both sides of the debate attracted large numbers of followers.  
It was all put to rest (at least from a scientific point of 
view) when one researcher who understood cryptography quite 
well managed to demonstrate that by reading the supposed 
typeface variations in different ways and supplying some 
additional overlays or adjustments of data (which the pro-
Bacon people said was necessary to read the hidden text), he 
could make Shakespeare's folio produce any hidden text he 
wanted it to!

Admittedly the cryptographic methods assumed by the pro-Bacon
group were faulty, and modern cryptanalysts would not make
the mistake of inserting a text-decryption overlay that in 
effect would be inserting the encrypted message they wanted 
to find.  Any astute analyst would spot this immediately. 
The trouble is that not everyone involved in trying to make
determinations of violation of anti-encryption law is quali-
fied either to avoid making such an analytical error or to
catch one being made.  And this statement makes no assump-
tion of malice.  What if malice IS the motive?

So perhaps someone might count the characters in each line in
this posting, convert the counts to characters with some 
simple arithmetic function, apply some transformation (either
transposition or substitution, with some arbitrary key) and
decide that I am a dangerous subversive because of the resul-
ting "content" emerging from this process.  There is in fact
no such content.

Another such someone might profess to have found another
message of mine which, when used as a key, produces a plain-
text from selected words in this message.  Between selecting
another message, and selecting the words, they could put
any concealed text in my message that they wanted to find.

Behind all this is the greasy odor of pseudoscience.  Once
a pseudoscientist sets mind on getting a result, all evidence
leads to it.  Or, as one wag put it, "When the theory does not
agree with the facts, the facts must be disposed of."  Mix
the pseudoscientists with the oppressive or manipulative 
politicians, and the results can be explosive.

It is a dangerous farce.  It could be worse law.

Turning to the other end of things, can any REAL concealed
ciphertext be detected?  The answer is, simply, no.  The
reason, strangely enough, is virtually the same as the reason
that the Bacon-cipher people thought they had succeeded.  
All the correspondents need to do is to establish two entirely
independent communications pathways, sending the apparent
plaintext message over one channel, and a key for extracting 
other messages from it over the other.  Unless a cryptanalyst
has access to both channels, no encrypted message sent on one 
channel can be decrypted if the encryption was done with a 
key based on a one-time pad (a once-used series of characters 
or values) sent over the other channel.  The Bacon-cipher
people did this unwittingly when they created the data 
overlays, which amounted to the key.

The channels need not occupy the same medium, nor the same
place or time.  A private conversation can serve as one
channel, and the public network(s) the other.  So if I wanted
to plant an encrypted message in this message, I would only
have to set up a key to produce it, and send the key via let-
ter, radio, telephone, carrier pigeon, whisper, etc. to the
intended recipients of the hidden message.  If I took care
with that communication, no one would have a clue.

And I could make this message contain two entirely contra-
dictory encryptions for two different recipients, just by
sending them different keys.

As an aside, this is how some people who tell fortunes or 
interpret holy scriptures make a living.  I'm not referring 
to honest students of scripture or human nature, only to the 
folks with an axe to grind or money to be made.  Such people 
can be extremely dismissive of scientific argument and 
evidence.


Hoping my recollections of the Bacon cipher controversy are 
basically accurate,

                   Free UNIX for the 386
The current version of linux is a 0.97, released 92.08.01.  There is a
0.96 rootdisk that should be used with the new versions: it fixes a lot
of things with the old rootdisks and contains more programs due to the
shared libraries.
0.97 supports X11r5 and the new gcc-2.1 (and newer) libraries with
multiple shared libs - as well as any old binaries (except the 0.12
version of gdb which used the older ptrace() interface).  0.96c also
contains support for debugging (core-dumping and attach/detach) as well
as profiling (use gcc-2.2.2 for the profiling code)
Linux can be gotten by anonymous ftp from 'nic.funet.fi' (128.214.6.100)
in the directory '/pub/OS/Linux'.  This directory structure contains all
the linux OS- and library-sources, and enough binaries to get going.  To
install linux you still need to know something about unices: it's
relatively straightforward to install, but the documentation sucks raw
eggs, and people with no previous unix experience are going to get very
confused.
There are now a lot of other sites keeping linux archives. Some of them
are:
  tsx-11.mit.edu (18.172.1.2):
    directory /pub/linux
  banjo.concert.net (192.101.21.6):
    directory /pub/Linux
  yagi.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp (130.34.222.67)
  
(and many additional sites: there are now sites in the uk, japan etc
that carry linux, but I have lost count)
There is also a mailing list set up 'Linux-activists@niksula.hut.fi'.
To join, mail a request to 'Linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi'.
It's no use mailing me: I have no actual contact with the mailing-list
(other than being on it, naturally).
There is also a newsgroup that contain linux-related questions and
information: comp.os.linux.

0.97 has these major new things relative to 0.96
 - select() through the VFS routines
 - easily installable IRQ's
 - bus-mouse driver
 - msdos filesystem (alpha)
 - extended filesystem (alpha)
 - serial line changes (faster, changeable irq's etc)
 - dynamic buffer-cache

Subject: Article 2--CNID press release

            PACIFIC BELL'S  PHONE PRIVACY RINGS FALSE, SAYS
          COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

PALO ALTO, Calif., August 10, 1992 -- Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility (CPSR), a national alliance of professionals
concerned with the impact of technology on society based here,
expressed deep concern over Pacific Bell's attempt to gut a recent
California Public Utility Commission (PUC) order on Calling-Number
Identification (CNID).  Pacific Bell has requested a rehearing on the
PUC restrictions.  PacBell's proposal will eliminate important safety
and privacy protections in the Commission's order, CPSR charged.
CNID allows businesses to collect the phone numbers of customers
who call them.

The Commission's order guarantees privacy protections for all
Californians.  PacBell proposes to eliminate a key privacy protection
called Per-Line Blocking with Per-Call Unblocking.  This feature
prevents home numbers from being collected by businesses, unless
the caller decides to give it to them.  Phone companies would prefer
to only offer per-call blocking, a scheme in which caller numbers are
always given out unless the caller remembers to dial a blocking code
before dialing the desired number.

"If this happens, Californians will inevitably receive more junk mail,
more annoying phone calls, and greater invasions of their privacy,
some of which may be dangerous," said CPSR Chair and user interface
expert, Dr. Jeff Johnson.

PacBell claims that CNID would give people more control over their
privacy by providing the phone number from the calling phone.  This
is the wrong technological answer to the problem according to
Johnson.  "What people want to know is who is calling, not what
phone is being used.  If my wife's car breaks down and she calls me
from a pay phone, that's a call I want to answer.  CNID doesn't give
me any information that will help me do that."


In PUC hearings held last year, Johnson accused the phone companies
of designing a service that is more useful for businesses in gathering
marketing data than for consumers in screening calls.  Phone
companies are opposed to per-line blocking because it would
presumably result in more numbers being kept private, thereby
reducing the value of the CNID service to business subscribers.

"Phone companies don't want you to block your phone number when
you call movie theaters or appliance stores.  The more times your
number is revealed to businesses, the better!  So they oppose
reasonable blocking options and are pushing an error-prone one," he
said.

If only per-call blocking were available, residential phone customers
-- or their children, parents, grandparents, guests  --  would often
forget to dial their blocking code before making a call, resulting in
frequent disclosure of private information to businesses without the
consent, and sometimes even without the knowledge, of the caller.

"Unless PacBell is willing to live within the very reasonable bounds
set by the PUC decision, the concerns of Californians will be far better
served if CNID is simply not offered at all,"  said Johnson.
"Subscriber privacy is more important that Pacific Bell's profits."

Founded in 1981, CPSR is a public interest alliance of computer
scientists and other professionals interested in the impact of
computer technology on society.  As technical experts and informed
citizens, CPSR members provide the public and policy makers with
realistic assessments of the power, promise, and limitations of
computer technology.  It is a national organization, with 21 chapters
throughout the United States.  The organization also has program
offices in Washington D.C. and Cambridge, MA.

RE:  Public Access to Senate and House LEGIS


Dear Sirs:

This letter is to request that the public be granted access to the
Legislative Information Systems operated by the United States Senate and
House of Representatives.  These taxpayer financed information systems
provide online access to information of immense interest to millions of
citizens.  (For purposes of this letter the two systems will be referred
to simply as LEGIS).

Examples of the information contained in LEGIS are:

-       Summary information about the content and status of all
        Senate and House bills, resolutions, floor amendments,
        public and private laws

-       Full text of the latest versions of Senate and House bills

-       Summary information on all Presidential nominations
        requiring Senate confirmation

-       Summary information on treaties submitted to the Senate for
        ratification

-       Summary information on communications from the executive
        branch and state and local governments on matters before the
        Congress

Our specific recommendations are as follows:


1.      CITIZENS SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEARCH LEGIS ONLINE FROM REMOTE
        LOCATIONS.

While the public pays for the operation of LEGIS we have never
been allowed access, except for limited walk-in access in
Congressional reading rooms.  This policy should change.  In a
period when Congress is seeking to reform itself, it is
appropriate to extend access to these valuable information
systems beyond the members and staff of congress, to the citizens
whom they serve.


2.      PUBLIC ACCESS TO LEGIS SHOULD BE MODELED ON THE PROPOSED GPO
        GATEWAY TO GOVERNMENT/WINDO LEGISLATION.

As sponsors of S. 2813, the GPO Gateway to Government, and H.R.
2772, the GPO Wide Information Network for Data Online (WINDO),
you have worked hard to expand public access to federal
databases.  Should the Gateway/WINDO become law, LEGIS should be
among its initial core databases.  In any event, the approach
taken in these two bills is appropriate for LEGIS.

[[ED: More information on the Gateway/WINDO is in AoT-Digest #2]]

-       The public should have the right to subscribe to online
        access to LEGIS from remote locations.  For most
        subscribers, the cost of the subscription should be based on
        the incremental cost of providing such access.

-       LEGIS information should also be made available without
        charge through the federal Depository Library Program.  As
        you know, this important program, which began in the middle
        of the 19th century, is designed to promote universal access
        to federal government information.

3.      CONGRESS SHOULD REGULARLY SOLICIT FEEDBACK FROM LEGIS USERS
        TO DETERMINE IF THE SYSTEM CAN BE IMPROVED.

There are several areas where LEGIS could be improved.  For
example, some citizens may ask that Congress provide more
detailed information on voting, committee actions, or other
congressional business.  Citizens should have opportunities to
identify the types of information that would be useful in
monitoring the actions of the Congress.

Your support for the Gateway/WINDO bills is deeply appreciated,
as are your other efforts to broaden public access to databases
and information systems that are financed by the taxpayer.
Please inform us of the specific steps that you will take to
broaden public access to LEGIS.  Thank you.


Sincerely,

Subject: Article 5--Encryption Bull

I think that any laws the government has on how you can encrypt data,
where you can bring the data, or what you can do with the encrytion method
is a bunch of bull. I am not sure about what the laws actually are, but I
heard that many US products which have encryption, DES or otherwise, are not
allowed in other countries and then to be taken back to the US. It's not a
matter of security. It is volating our rights. People across the world cannot
register PKWare's PKLITE because they can't use the -e option in their country
is pretty bad. We have free speech. That's great. We don't have the right to
encrypt e-mail because a new law is coming. How are they going to stop us?
UU/XX Encoding is, in a way, a form of encryption, isn't it?? So what's the
big deal if I send somebody an encrypted form of AoT-D because I don't want
anybody else reading it until it is actually released? There's no security
matter involved. DES Encryption is used by the government only for Un-
classified and sensitive information (If I remeber all those NTISS and DoD/
NCSC Memorandums correctly). And, think about this, why does the government
even waste time encrypting *unclassified* documents, when anybody can simply
write the IAOC (INFOSEC Awareness Division; ATTN: X713/IAOC; Fort George G.
Meade, MD 20755-6000; (410)766-8729 Barbara Keller) and get some unclassified
government documents for free (sort of like a free version of the GPO). If
anybody actually knows the laws for this or has another opinion, please
respond.

 Pirates v. AT&T: Posters
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Special thanks to Legacy Irreverent and Captain Picard

On May 24 1992, two lone pirates, Legacy (of CyberPunk System) and Captain
Picard (of Holodeck) had finally had enough of AT&T.  Together, they traveled
to the AT&T Maintenance Facility (just west of Goddard, Kansas) and claimed the
property in the name of pirates and hackers everywhere.

They hoisted the Jolly Roger skull and crossbones high on the AT&T flagpole,
where it stayed for two days until it was taken down by security.

This event was photographed and videotaped by EGATOBAS Productions, to preserve
this landmark in history.  And now you can witness the event.  For a limited
time they are offering full color posters and t-shirts of the Jolly Roger
Pirate flag flying high over AT&T, with the AT&T logo in plain view, with the

Subject: Article 8--Intel Releases 486 DX2 66 Megahertz Chip

****Intel Releases 486 DX2 66 Megahertz Chip 08/10/92  SANTA CLARA,
CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1992 AUG 10 (NB) -- Intel has announced its fastest
version of the speed doubler family microprocessor chips, the 486 DX2
66 megahertz (MHz) clock speed central processing unit (CPU), is now
shipping.

The chip is designed to help original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to
upgrade the computing performance of computers they've already
manufactured without redesigning their motherboards. The new DX2 chip
runs internally at 66 (MHz), but works on motherboards designed for 33
(MHz) so a simple replacement of the CPU is all that is necessary to
upgrade the computer.

While the 66 MHz processing speed means the data may move through the
chip faster, it may still have to wait on the slower 33 MHz motherboard
to get to it. Intel estimates users will see performance increases of
as much as 70 percent overall.

This is the highest performance chip in the DX2 family. Earlier this
year Intel released a 486 DX2 50 MHz chip designed to be placed in
motherboards designed for the 486 DX 25 MHz CPU.

On the heels of the Intel announcement, several major manufacturers
have announced the availability of personal computers based on the new
chip. Dell, Compaq, and Everex, have announced new models based on the
486 DX2 66 MHz chip. IBM has announced an upgrade card so users can
upgrade PS/2 Model 90 and 95 systems.

A consumer version of the chip, so users can upgrade a 486 33 MHz IBM
or compatible personal computer to the 486 DX2 66 MHz is expected next
year. Intel already has a consumer version of its 486 DX2 50 MHz chip
which can replace the 486 DX 25 MHz chip.

In order to ramp production on the 486 DX2 line, Intel has already
announced it is putting off the release of the next generation chip,
internally code named the P5, until next year as well.

Intel says the 486 DX2 66 MHz chip costs $682 each in quantities of
1,000 and the company says it has shipped more than 20,000 of them
already.

IBM Offers 66MHz DX2 Upgrade For Top-End PS/2s 08/10/92  WHITE PLAINS,
NEW YORK, U.S.A., 1992 AUG 10 (NB) -- Like several of its rivals, IBM
has wasted no time in offering customers Intel's new top-of-the-line
microprocessor. IBM announced that the 66-megahertz 486DX2 chip is
available now as a processor complex upgrade for its Personal System/2
Model 90 and Model 95 machines.

The new 486DX2 uses Intel's clock-doubling technology to run at 66
megahertz internally while exchanging data with the rest of the system
at 33 megahertz. According to IBM, using it to replace the existing
processor in a Model 90 or 95 PS/2 can boost the machine's over-all
performance by as much as 71 percent.

The processor upgrade card replaces the existing microprocessor, memory
controller, memory cache options, and control for system throughput.

IBM said the upgrade card is ideal for the high-performance
requirements of computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM),
financial modelling, image and presentation graphics, and other
compute-intensive applications.

The 486DX2-66 upgrade can be installed in PS/2 Model 90 XP 486 and
Model 95 XP 486 systems. At Newsbytes' deadline, an IBM spokesman was
unable to confirm whether an end-user can install the card or whether
it requires a technician.

US customers can purchase the upgrade from IBM-authorized dealers and
remarketers, as well as direct from IBM. For installation information
and technical guidance, customers can call on IBM's Systems Support
Center in Dallas.

Customers can upgrade from a 20-megahertz 486SX processor for $3,000,
from a 25-megahertz 486SX for $2,500, from a 33-megahertz 486DX chip
for $2,170, and from a 50-megahertz 486DX2 for $1,670.

Initial supplies are shipping now and the upgrade will be available in
volume "soon," the spokesman said.

Rivals Compaq and Dell have also announced machines based on the new
66-megahertz DX2 chip.

q: Should my university allow students to post to Netnews?

a: Yes. Free inquiry and free expression are an important part of a
university's mission. Most universities encourage and support student
expression and publication. Most universities also seem to give full
network access to all users, even students. (This conclusion is based
on an informal survey posted to comp.admin.policy in October, 1991.
[cafv01n33])

There is probably no need to create special rules for student computer
media; your university likely already has rules for student media.
(Look in your Student Code.) In the U.S., most student publications
are free of university screening, censorship, and most retaliation.
(For state universities, this is a legal requirement.) At the same
time, most universities disclaim responsibility for student
publications, even when the university "owns the presses."

Comments from _Public Schools Law: Teachers' and Students' Rights_ 2nd

boards are not obligated to support student papers, if a given
publication was originally created as a free speech forum, removal of
financial or other school board support can be construed as an
unlawful effort to stifle free expression." Also, "school
authorities cannot withdraw support from a student publication simply
because of displeasure with the content" and "the content of a
school-sponsored paper that is established as a medium for student
expression cannot be regulated more closely than a nonsponsored
paper". Also, it tells what to do about libel in student

It concludes: "The founding fathers of this nation produced a
remarkable document in the Constitution but it was ratified only with
the promise of the Bill of Rights.  The First Amendment is central to
our concept of freedom.  The God-given "unalienable rights" that the
infant nation rallied to in the Declaration of Independence can be
preserved only if their application is rigorously analyzed.

The problems of bigotry and discrimination sought to be addressed here
are real and truly corrosive of the educational environment.  But
freedom of speech is almost absolute in our land and the only
restriction the fighting words doctrine can abide is that based on the
fear of violent reaction.  Content-based prohibitions such as that in
the UW Rule, however well intended, simply cannot survive the
screening which our Constitution demands."

Also, a paraphrase from an ACLU handbook _The Rights of Teachers_. It
says that generally, speech, if otherwise shielded from punishment by
the First Amendment, does not lose that protection because its tone is
sharp.

Also, from p. 92, it says that there are legal limits to what a
(public) school can ask its teachers to sign. [Some of these same
limits might apply to what a school can ask a user to sign as a
condition of getting (or keeping) a computer account.]

                   during periods of critical need.

    A special circut in the machine called a `critical dectector'
    senses  the  operator's  emotional  state  in  terms  of how
    desperate  he  or  she  is  to use the machine. The `critical

Subject: Article 2--Legalities re: new encryption program
Date: 1 Sep 92 02:54:15 GMT

First of all, even though I'm sending this posting through OSU (where I'm a
graduate student), I'm making it in my capacity as a partner in an independent
company - we don't have internet access yet...

This posting is a request for some information from the security world out
there.  Basically, we'd like to find out what legal requirements/hurdles exist
for the sale of a new data encryption algorithm.

More specifically, we've developed a data encryption program based on a new
type of random number generation.  This generator produces a stream of numbers
with the following basic properties:
     1) The cycle of repetition is at least 10^34 (ten to the thirty-fourth).
     2) The correlations between any sections of the numbers is statistically
  zero (with a very high level of confidence).
     3) 2^128 (two to the one hundred twenty eighth) different number streams
  can be generated (ie. there are 2^128 different keys).
     4) Changing the key be even one bit is guaranteed to change over 99% of
  the numbers.
     5) The cross correlations between each different number stream is almost
  zero. (With a normalized correlation of 1 being complete correlation,
  and a sample size of 8000 numbers, the typical correlation values are
  around 0.01; sometimes they are as high as 0.05, and sometimes they
  are as low as 0.00001).

The applications for such a generator in encryption are obvious.  Now, we're
curious about the legal side of selling something like this.  Are there
special certification, registrations, etc. that have to be taken care of?  Can
such a program even be distributed/sold legally?  Will we get squashed by the
government (Agents burst into the apartment and take everything at bazooka
point ;-> )?

Also, we're thinking about distributing a free copy of a limited version of
the program for the internet world to try out.  This version would only be
able to encrypt files of size 10k or less, would be time-bombed (ie. die off
after a certain date), and would probably not incorporate the most efficient
implementation of the generator (ie. it would be slow).  We're also thinking
about releasing an encrypted message and most of the corresponding clear text,
with a fee of $500 offered to whoever can "break" the encryption first (This
is just an idea right now - the rules to such an experiment would have to be
spelled out in detail - not something to bore you with now.)  Any comments on
the legality/risks involved with doing this?

Please respond here or send e-mail to butzerd@eng.ohio-state.edu.

Thanks, and if this is the wrong place to have posted this, or if this message
seems too commercial, sorry - I'm new at posting to the internet :-) Also, I
had no clue as to where else to go to get this information.

Subject: Article 3--New Journal
Date: 2 Sep 92 10:41:15 GMT

Keeping up with research in computer and communications security is
becoming a very time-consuming activity. A conscientious researcher in 
the field would have had to read well over 600 papers last year; and 
as the amount of research activity grows, the problem can only get worse.

We are currently developing, with Cambridge University Press, an abstracting
service designed to solve this problem.

Computer and Communications Security Abstracts will summarise 
research in computer security topics such as access control, database 
security, formal methods, distributed systems, biometrics, security 
management, risk management, contingency planning, legal issues, audit, and
applications; and in communications security topics including stream and
block cipher techniques, public key cryptography and computational number
theory, complexity and theoretical cryptography, cryptanalysis, 
authentication, protocols, and applications.

Our mission is to provide abstracts of as much published research and
development work as possible. This includes not just conference and journal
papers, but also research reports and theses. We will make a particular
effort to report work which is published in languages other than English,
or which for other reasons might escape the notice of the research
community.

We expect that the first issue will be published in March 1993. It will be
quarterly to begin with, and become bi-monthly once a sufficient flow of
abstracts has been established. These should be a dummy issue out at the 
end of 1992, which will be circulated with subscription information.

If you could be able to help us with abstracting work (particularly in
foreign languages), then we would be very keen to hear from you.

Material published in the main periodicals (IEE and IEEE journals, Journal
of Cryptology, Mathematics of Computation, Journal of Computer Security,
Computers and Security, Cryptologia) and the main conference proceedings, 
will be reviewed automatically. However, if you are publishing material 
elsewhere - such as in the form of a departmental research report, or in a 
provincial journal - we would suggest that you sent us an offprint to 
ensure coverage. This should be mailed to:

Subject: Article 4--UFC (Ultra Fast Crypt) on CM200
Date: 2 Sep 92 19:36:57 GMT

Dear fellows,

The project: The implementation of UFC (Ultra Fast Crypt) on UNI-C's
CM200 is now finished.

The work was done by Michael Glad, who is also the auther of UFC.
The CM200 is a small Connection Mashine (parallel computer)
with 8K CPUs from Thinking Machines Corporation.

Below are the results:

  - The C* (C-star) version of UFC can crypt 55,000 words pr. second.
    It is higly optimized and uses special PARIS functions in all the
    time comsuming parts.

  - The Fortran version af UFC can "only" crypt 25,000 words pr. second.

  - The C* version implemented as the standard crypt() function
    can crypt 53,000 words pr. second.
        
The task is embarrassing parallel and is therefore linarly scalable.
So on the largest CM200 (64 K processors) the crypt() function can
crypt 424,000 words pr. second.

At the moment, the Fortran version of UFC can crypt 85,000 words pr.
second on a small CM-5 (128 nodes) with vector units and it is NOT
optimized yet.

Does anyone know who is running the fastest password cracking program
(crypt() function) on a SINGLE machine?

Please do * NOT * respond if your answer cant'be documented or verified!
There are just too many rumors around . . .


Thanks in advance

Subject: Article 5--AT&T USL vs. BSDI/UCB, Mach3, OSF/1, GNU HURD, Linux
Date: 30 Aug 92 22:59:02 GMT

The USL suit has direr implications that most people realize. The FSF
has decided to abandon the BNR2SS server as it is derived from the
disputed NET2 sources, and CMU have withdrawn the BNR2SS sources
from public distribution. The FSF is considering building a Mach3 server
based on Linux.

Unfortunately, I reckon this is pointless. Let's look at USL claims
in the BSDI/UCB suit:

1) NET2 and thus BSDI/386 contain USL copyrighted text, or its
   derivative.

2) NET2 and thus BSDI/386 embody USL trade secrets licensed to
   UCB, and by UCB disclosed to BSDI or its employees.

The defense by UCB/BSDI is that:

1) all text copyrighted by USL has been removed from NET2 and thus
   from BSDI/386, and substituted with original text.

2) no USL trade secret was employed in writing the replacement text,
   but only original or publicly known techniques.

The interesting aspect of this matter is that the above points, both
USL's and UCB/BSDI's, apply *exactly* to Mach3 itself.

The lineage of Mach3 starts from 4.1BSD+Accent IPC, and by a process of
various releases all USL copyrighted text has been removed, and new text
written in its stead, until Mach3 was obtained, just like NET2 was.

Not only that, all the authors of Mach3 have been exposed to the very
same USL trade secrets to which the UCB/BSDI people have been, as both
groups of researchers have worked for (over) ten years on various
releases of USL source text.

It can actually be argued that if USL wins the UCB/BSDI case, then
*all* staff and students of *any* institution or company that has an
USL Unix source license must be presumed to have been exposed to the
trade secrets contained therein, unless it can proven otherwise.

  Doing so requires proving that the sources have been kept secure and all
  people who have accessed them have been logged -- once the license has
  been granted, all staff and students of the licensee are bound by it,
  and the burden of proving that they never had access to the secret text
  is on them, and even if they can I have doubts that it matters).

So, if USL wins the UCB/BSDI suit by having the court accepting its
contentions, then Mach3 most probably falls too as the next step, and
(less probably) so any and all Unix like code developed by staff or
students of any organization with a Unix source license.

It would astonish me if, having set a precedent w.r.t. UCB/NET2/BSDI,
USL were not to use it immediately w.r.t. CMU/Mach3/FSF. By doing so
they would effectively prevent the OSF, with their current staff, from
producing an OSF/n that does not require an USL Unix source license.

So, giving up on BNR2SS buys essentially nothing, if one continues to
use Mach3 as the substratum

The sure way for the FSF to have an unenncumbered OS would be to adopt
Linux, if it can be proven that Linus Benedict never worked or studied
at an organization with a Unix source license, or if he did, that he
never was exposed to it.

Or one could continue to use BNR2SS with Mach3, because they are bound
to stand or fall together.

Subject: Article 6--Important N.S.W. Report released

A long-running 'Independent Commission Against Corruption' enquiry in
N.S.W. has finally reported on an investigation into leakage of personal
data to private enquiry agents, and the leading Sydney daily had over 2
large pages devoted to the matter.  Here's the lead article.

HUGE TRADE IN PERSONAL FILES
By MALCOLM BROWN

Westpac, National Australia Bank, NRMA Insurance Ltd, Custom Credit and
Citicorp are some of the big names in a damning report by the ICAC
Assistant Commissioner, Mr Adrian Roden, QC, on the unauthorised release of
confidential government information.

Mr Roden found that there was a multi-million-dollar trade in such
information which involved public servants, including police, and private
inquiry agents.

"Information, from a variety of State and Commonwealth government sources
and the private sector has been freely and regularly sold and exchanged for
many years," he said. "NSW public officials have been heavily involved."

Mr Roden heard 446 witnesses in public and private hearings over 168 days
before compiling his 1,300-page report.

Even so, he said, it was necessary to be selective; thousands of private
and commercial inquiry agents had not examined.

Mr Roden found that more than 250 people had participated in the illicit
trade or had contributed to it.

Of these, 155 had engaged in corrupt conduct. A further 101 had engaged in
conduct which allowed, encouraged or caused the occurrence of corrupt
conduct.

Many are NSW and Commonwealth public servants who sold information
collected by the agencies where they work, including the Roads and Traffic
Authority (RTA), police force, Telecom and Sydney County Council.

The Attorney-General, Mr Hannaford, announced that the Director of Public
Prosecutions had set up a task force to consider laying charges against
more than 100 people named in the report.

He said many of the public servants named could expect to lose their jobs
and that the heads of all the government departments involved had been told
to examine the report and take action against those involved.

The Assistant Police Commissioner, Mr Col Cole, confirmed yesterday that
five police officers had been suspended and announced that three task
forces had been set up and computer security upgraded.

Mr Hannaford foreshadowed the introduction of privacy legislation to make
the unauthorised use of confidential information a criminal offence.

The major banks said that they could not condone what their staff had done
but said the staff had believed that they were acting in the best interests
of their employers and the community.

None of the banks was planning to sack staff found to be corrupt although
several said the staff had been counselled or "educated".

Mr Roden said the trade involved banks, insurance companies and other
financial institutions which had provided "a ready market".

The link was provided by private and commercial inquiry agents. With some
banks, codes had been used to conceal the nature of the transactions.

"As they have gone about their corrupt trade, commercial interest has
prevailed over commercial ethics, greed ha~ prevailed over public duty;
laws and regulations designed to protect confidentiality have been
ignored," Mr Roden said.

"Frequently the client, generally an insurance company, bank or other
financial institution, ordered the information from the agent with a full
appreciation of how it was to be obtained.

"The evidence disclosed that in the collection and recovery departments of
a number of those institutions, it has long been standard practice to use
confidential government information . . . as a means of locating debtors."

Some finance and insurance companies had directed agents to keep all
references to the trade off invoices and reports.

"Some even directed that the agents falsely state the source of the
information in their reports," Mr Roden said.

"Some solicitors in private practice have sought and purchased confidential
government information in circumstances in which they must have known that
it could not have been properly obtained."

Mr Kevin Rindfleish, an unlicensed private inquiry agent, had sold
Department of Motor Transport/Roads and Traffic Authority and social
security information "on a large scale". His principal client had been the
ANZ Bank.

A private investigator, Mr Terence John Hancock, and his company, All
Cities Investigations Pty Ltd, had sold confidential government information
to the National Australia Bank and Westpac on a regular basis.

 Two employees of the NAB had used prior contacts to provide the bank with
access to RTA, social security, Australia Post and immigration information.
Between them, the employees also provided silent numbers and information on
electricity consumers.

The Advance Bank had "over a period of years" obtained information
improperly released from the RTA, the Department of Social Security and the
Department of Immigration. The practice was "known and approved at least to
senior management level".

New Zealand Insurance and Manufacturers Mutual had bought confidential
government information from private investigators.

NRMA Insurance Ltd and the Government Insurance Office were "found to have
participated as freely in the illicit trade in confidential government
information as their more commercially orientated competitors".

"Evidence relating to NRMA Insurance Ltd established not only that it
purchased confidential government information through private
investigators, but also that investigators were required to obtain relevant
government information by unauthorised means if they were to retain the
company's work."

Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd had bought confidential information over at
least 23 years. Custom Credit Corporation Ltd which had engaged in the
illicit trade over "many years", had maintained false records to conceal
how it obtained information.

Alston de Zilwa, former underwriter and operations manager of Citicorp Ltd
and later, Toyota Finance Australia Limited's credit operations manager,
had established for each of the two companies a system for obtaining
confidential information.

The companies would seek information directly from employees of the DMA and
RTA and pay a private inquiry agent, Mr Kevin Robinson, who would "launder"
it, then invoice the companies for the corresponding sum.

Mr Roden said that hundreds of thousands of dollars had changed hands in
the trade uncovered. One agent had estimated that he had paid $40,000 to
$50,000 a year for Social Security information alone.

Another had said he received $100,000 over two years for government
information.

Yet another had, according to records, charged a bank $186,000 for "inquiry
services" over a period of 18 months.

Article 7--Fido-Usenet Gateway

Part 1: Need to know about Fido-Usenet gatewaying!
Part 2: Re: Need to know about Fido-Usenet gatewaying!

From: mjo@ef2007.efhd.ford.com (Mike O'Connor)
Subject: Need to know about Fido-Usenet gatewaying!
Date: 2 Sep 92 14:09:40 GMT

Situation:

I would like to gateway existing local Fidonet echoes into a local
Usenet system.  I would like for this to be a bi-directional gateway,
such that the Usenet people can post and have their posts "make it"
into the Fidonet universe.  I also want mail to work, such that a Fido
person can mail someone that posts from the Usenet easily and vice
versa.  Low-fuss maintenance is a priority.

What I have:

A.  A user with a PC who's more than willing to transmogrify his
echoes in a reasonable fashion such that they make it to the Usenet.

B.  A site that talks UUCP that'd very much prefer to receive the
Fidonet echoes as news batches.

C.  Someone who knows a bit from both the Unix and MS-DOS end who
wants to see this thing happen and is willing to sweat over a hot PC,
gallantly sacrificing time and energy to do the initial setup.  :)

What I think I need:

A.  Software at the MS-DOS end that mutates the Fido echoes we want
into properly-formed UUCP batches in an organized manner.

B.  Software that can talk UUCP to the Unix/Usenet end in an automated
fashion (i.e. when the rest of the Fido transfers are taking place.)

C.  Some idea of the administrative issues that may occur.  I want to
help both the Fido and Usenet communities, not tick them off.

Any assistance would be *greatly* appreciated.  I have directed
followups to news.sysadmin, but if people don't have access to that,
feel free to send me email.  I'd like to get this going relatively
quickly (Labor Day?).  I will post a summary of how I make things
work, *if* I manage to make things work.


            ...Mike

Both of the above are handled by UFGATE on the PC.

The Fido person will need to have a *long* talk with his NEC (Net Echo
Co-ordinator), and possible his REC and the ZEC (Regin and Zone ECs).
This is to avoid dupes on the Fido side. If the group is being gatewayed
elsewhere, he shouldn't gateway it again, he should get it from the existing 
gateway *or* make *very* sure that no one he feeds it to feeds it to a
site that has a feed path connectivity with the other gateway!

Once he has it set up ok, he should put a GUUCP flag in his nodelist
entry. (G= gateway to)

For that matter, you should talk to the existing gateways. Look for
the GUUCP flags!

Similar issues (with different solutions) apply on the Usenet side.

Most of the trouble is due to Fido using hierarchial distribution, 
and relying on on restricting crosslinks to suppress dupes, while
Usenet relies on message-IDs. Fido also has message-IDs, but they
have a format the you can't munge a Usenet ID into. And while most
gateway software preserves the Usenet Message-ID as part of the body
of the message, if it gets such a message from another Fido node,
it can't reverse the process (if it did, it'd make forgeries *way*
to easy).

Subject: Article 8--Linux 0.97pl2 Information
Date: 8/23/92

[[ED: Note changes in anonymous FTP sites]]


finger torvalds@kruuna.Helsinki.FI

                  Free UNIX for the 386

The current version of linux is a 0.97pl2, released 92.08.23.  There is
a 0.97.1 rootdisk that should be used with the new versions, but earlier
versions do work, although they may have some minor bugs. 

0.97pl2 supports X11r5 and the new gcc-2.1 (and newer) libraries with
multiple shared libs - as well as any old binaries (except the 0.12
version of gdb which used the older ptrace() interface).  It also
contains support for debugging (core-dumping and attach/detach) as well
as profiling: use gcc-2.2.2d for full utilization of all these features. 

Linux can be gotten by anonymous ftp from 'nic.funet.fi' (128.214.6.100)
in the directory '/pub/OS/Linux'.  This directory structure contains all
the linux OS- and library-sources, and enough binaries to get going.  To
install linux you still need to know something about unices: it's
relatively straightforward to install, but the documentation sucks raw
eggs, and people with no previous unix experience are going to get very
confused. 

There are now a lot of other sites keeping linux archives. The main ones
(as well as the above-mentioned nic.funet.fi) are: 
  tsx-11.mit.edu (18.172.1.2):
    directory /pub/linux
  sunsite.unc.edu (152.2.22.81):
    directory /pub/Linus

(and many additional sites: there are now sites in the uk, japan etc
that carry linux, but I have lost count)

There is also a mailing list set up 'Linux-activists@niksula.hut.fi'. 
To join, mail a request to 'Linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi'. 
It's no use mailing me: I have no actual contact with the mailing-list
(other than being on it, naturally).

There is also a newsgroup that contain linux-related questions and
information: comp.os.linux.

Mail me for more info:

    Linus Torvalds (torvalds@kruuna.Helsinki.FI)
    Pietarinkatu 2 A 2
    00140 Helsinki
    Finland

0.97.pl2 has these new features:
 - major mm rewrite: 3GB virtual process size
 - filesystem error reporting corrections
 - minor bugfixes

0.97 has these major new things relative to 0.96
 - select() through the VFS routines
 - easily installable IRQ's
 - bus-mouse driver
 - msdos filesystem (alpha)
 - extended filesystem (alpha)
 - serial line changes (faster, changeable irq's etc)
 - dynamic buffer-cache
 - new and improved SCSI drivers

From: ONASCH@irav17.ira.uka.de (Bernd Onasch)
Subject: Article 9--Announcement: VMS NEWS v1.24 released...
Date: 3 Sep 92 00:14:50 GMT

Hello alltogether,

VMS NEWS v1.24 is now available to the net...

VMS NEWS is a VAX/VMS full screen orientated NEWSreader supporting the
following network (TCP/IP) implementations:
  * CMU/tek
  * EXOS              (never tested, no site with it available)
  * MultiNet
  * Process Software
  * UCX               (1.x and 2.0 [DEC TCP/IP])
  * Wollongong
  * DECnet object     (tested the one of ANU NEWS 6.0.6)

The client supports various display methods:
  * Numbered  to just show the articles in order they came in
  * Subject   to display the articles sorted by subject line
  * Threaded  to display the articles sorted by threads (e.g. references)
In all cases, VMS NEWS offers a window where you can scroll around to select
the requested newsgroup or article.

Supported callable editors:
  * TECO (g'd old one)
  * EDT
  * EVE (TPU section)
  * EVE (LSEDIT section)

The command handling is VMSlike (DCL style). The display uses SMG$ routines
and is written for terminal usage (no X-Window support - I think that this is
not needed). The POST command should check for all possible problems that might
occur when a new user starts experimentation with it :-). A special "noscreen"
mode for BATCHes is also included. This allows programming of handlers to
save automatically parts of newsgroups etc.

*Grin* Not to forget - VMS NEWS is VMSlike - not UNIXlike - so there are no
compatibility modes to rn or any special handlings for native unix users :-).
The only reminder to rn is a possible conversion of rn-style register files
to VMS NEWS register files (that use much less disk space).
To be really VMSlike, there are HELP, MAIL and PRINT facilities included.

VMS NEWS is available from:
  * MAILserver FILESERV@irav17.ira.uka.de
    package NEWS_124 - VMSshare'd source
  * FTPserver iraun1.ira.uka.de (129.13.10.90)
    /pub/networks/news/news_1_24.com - VMSshare'd source
  * FTPserver info.rz.uni-ulm.de (134.60.1.125)
    /pub/VMS/communication/news124.zip - VMS zipped source

I offer ONLY the source (that is written entirely in VAX C) and NO executables.
I think sources are better for network software because they avoid trouble with
different libraries of different TCP/IP implementations. The pure execuables
might lead some sysop's to think of traps and hacks.

Greetings, Bernd Onasch

PS: VMS NEWS stands for "Very Mad Students NEWS"
    (no offense to DEC intended)

Subject: Article 11--Microsoft Windows NT Device Driver Developers Conference
Date: 31 Aug 92 21:28:04 GMT

Microsoft Windows NT Device Driver Developers Conference

Monday, October 26 to Wednesday, October 28, 1992
Anaheim, California

Location: Disneyland Hotel
Anaheim, California
Telephone: (714) 956-6425

Sponsor: Microsoft Corporation

The purpose of this conference is to provide information and understanding
on the model to support various devices, such as displays, printers,
network adapters, SCSI peripherals, audio products, and more, under
Windows NT. The presentations will discuss the entire structure and design
of Windows NT as it relates to developing drivers to support various
devices. The pre-liminary Windows NT Device Driver Kit is included with
registration of this event and includes sample source code for many
drivers, testing and debugging tools (the Win32 Software Development Kit
is required for actual device driver development and is not included with
registration)

At the Windows NT Device Driver Developers Conference, the developers and
designers of Windows NT will present details on various components of the
operating system like the Windows NT Kernel and the I/O Subsystem and how
they impact device drivers. Further, you'll have numerous opportunities to
discover technical "how-tos" and the latest development tips for a broad
range of devices including:

    * Printers            * Communication devices
    * Keyboards           * Mouse/Pointing devices
    * Display adapters    * Audio
    * Network adapters    * SCSI devices
    * 3270 adapters       * Fax
    * Scanners            * and other devices

This is a great opportunity to hear directly from key developers,
including David Cutler, Architect and Director of Windows NT Development.

And, so that you can be among the first to have your hardware take
advantage of this powerful operating system, we'll give you a free copy of
the preliminary Windows NT Device Driver Kit (DDK) and successive updates
include the final version, a $500 value.

Windows NT's architecture provides a 32-bit device driver model with great
functionality, security, and portability across different hardware
platforms - Intel, MIPS, and DEC Alpha. Imagine how users could benefit,
and you could profit, from your hardware products running under the
Windows NT operating system on not only the huge installed base of PCs but
on workstations using high performance RISC processors or multi-processor
systems. This hardware support will enable PCs to meet the increasing
end-user demands for varied functionality such as fast, high resolution
graphics and integrated networking.

Some of the speakers are the same as those who presented at the Win32 PDC
in San Francisco, but all of the talks at this conference will be focused
on hardware support and the particular needs of device driver writers. The
second and third day will be made up of more than 35 breakout and general
sessions containing completely new material focused on the specific issues
of the devices listed above.

To order a preliminary Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
NT, please contact (800) 227-4679 for specific details. The preliminary
Win32 SDK has a retail price of $69 for a CD only option, and $399 for an
option including the CD and hard copy documentation. These prices include
follow on updates to this product including the final release.

Subject: Article 1--What?

Hi, welcome to the 5th (finally after a month!) issue of AoT-Digest. Well
we are getting more readers daily and I think this thing is working out.
This issue is a double-issue, because I forgot to put it out earlier, I
just collected more articles and now letting it out. Have you been noticing
the political jokes put right before the first message? See, right up there?
Hmm. Well I am again in need of a Unix account on any unix-machine that is
accessable via Michnet (a machine with a 35.x.x.x or 141.x.x.x IP address)
and I only have as much money as any other 8th grader (none) so I really
can't pay. Anyways, hope you like this, and more will eventually come!

Greetings,

Date     :  September 06th 1992
Subject  :  Alt.znet and related groups

For      :  New Zealand, WORLD


As you may recall we requested a RFD for a news group in the atari
section to carry all the Z*NET FNET feeds.  Well I guess it was the
old story of no-one wanting it so it is not going ahead.

What we have done is placed all the news in a ALT group instead.
We have over this weekend placed over 200 messages in the news
group alt.znet.fnet relating from things like Bob Brodie (from
Atari Inc USA) talking about the Falcon to people talking about
the award Z*NET PC won this year.

We have created a series of news groups under the ALT.ZNET banner
being ..

             alt.znet.aeo  <- this is an ascii magazine called
                               Atari Explorer On-line (ex ZNET)
                               and carries not only the magazine
                               but also the discussion on AEO.
             alt.znet.pc   <-  this is also an ascii magazine
                               dealing with the PC/UNIX/OS2/
                               Windows world of computing. This
                               news group also carries the magazine
                               and other topics of interest relating
                               to it.
             alt.znet.fnet <-  this is the Z*NET FNET gateway. Here
                               you have a chance to talk back to the
                               FNET conferences. Currently we are
                               running at about 100 messages aday
                               including input from Fido-net as well.

We have not created the alt.znet.zmag at this point as the 8 bitters
have indicated they do not want this magazine in the net at this point
in time. However it is available as well should demand require it.

Well I hope you enjoy all the new news from Atari to OS2 and every machine
on the way.  Any comments can be directed to Ron at his CIS address or
via the gateway here to znet@status.gen.nz

Remember to ask your system administrator to carry the alt.znet groups
in your _country_.

Best regards

The Z*NET Global News Gateway Crew.
Z*NET free ascii magazines dealing with most brands of computers.

Subject: Article 3--Interesting 800 Number Service Available
Date: Wed, 16 Sep 92 15:44:06 GMT

Came across an interesting phone service, thot I'd pass it along.

I have a little brochure from a phone company called "Dial 8". What
they're offering is your very own 800 number. Initially this number
is assigned to your home or business. But there's an option (for $20)
where you can also specify four other phone numbers to apply this
800 number to. You get a PIN number for each of these other numbers.
This 800 number can be used from anywhere at any time of day. And, you
could specify four BBSs to dial up to, as opposed to, say, a business
or another household. The brochure says other numbers can be added
for a small fee.

They have two sign up plans. Plan 1 has no monthly service, rates are
23 cents a minute. Plan 2 is 20 cents a minute, and has a $10 monthly
service fee. Existing long distance service is unaffected.

An interesting way to cut down on phone bills. Here's their address
and phone number (I don't know if they're accessible via email, the
brochure doesn't say):

  Dial-8, Inc.
  243 E. 19th Ave., Suite 206
  Denver, CO 80203-9798
  1-800-489-2909

Happy dialing.

23c/minute is $13.80/hour, 20c/min is $12/hr. Most long-distance
carriers, domestic/residential, are less than that interstate.

Typical business rates for 800 service from IXC's (MCI, Sprint, etc)
are 18c-21c/min depending on zones.

Have you had any experience with working with people at a site remote
to you? Do you telework? Do you have to communicate with colleagues in
a different continent? If so, I'd be interested to hear about the
triumphs and the woes.

How did you communicate with your colleagues?  What kinds of systems
did you use e.g. phone, fax, groupware, etc?  What worked well and why? What
were the problems you encountered? What adaptations to your behaviour
did you have to make in order to cope with the remoteness of your
colleagues? How did the physical distance between you affect your
working practices? How were the social/managerial relationships in the
group affected? How did you feel about having to work with colleagues
you couldn't meet on a daily basis?

Please email your anecdotes, thoughts, etc. etc. on teleworking and
global communication to:

  "CPSR Seeks Wiretap Info from FBI"
PRESS RELEASE
WASHINGTON, DC

4:30 pm

Contact:
  Marc Rotenberg, CPSR Director (202/544-9240)

   CPSR Sues FBI For Information About Wiretap Proposal:
                Seeks Reasons for New Plan


  Washington, DC - Computer Professional for Social
Responsibility filed suit today against the FBI for
information about a new wiretap proposal.  The proposal would
expand FBI wiretap power and give the Bureau authority to set
technical standards for the computer and communications industry.

  The suit was filed after the FBI failed to make the
information public.  In April, CPSR requested documents from
the Bureau about the reasons for the proposal. The FBI denied
that any information existed.  But when CPSR pursued the
matter with the Department of Justice, the Bureau conceded
that it had the information.  Now CPSR is trying to force the
Bureau to disclose the records.

  The proposal expands the FBI's ability to intercept
communications.  It would mandate that every communication
system in the United States have a built-in "remote
monitoring" capability to make wiretap easier. The proposal
covers all communication equipment from office phone systems
to advanced computer networks.  Companies that do not comply
face fines of $10,000 per
day.

  The proposal is opposed by leading phone companies and computer
manufacturers, including AT&T, IBM, and Digital
Equipment Corporation.  Many charge that the FBI has not
been adequately forthcoming about the need for the
legislation.

  According to CPSR Washington Office director Marc
Rotenberg, "A full disclosure of the reasons for this
proposal is necessary.  The FBI simply cannot put forward
such a sweeping recommendation, keep important documents
secret, and expect the public to sign off."

  In a related effort, a 1989 CPSR FOIA suit uncovered
evidence that the FBI established procedures to monitor
computer bulletin boards in 1982.

  CPSR is a national membership organization of computer
professionals with over 2,500 members based in Palo Alto,
California with offices in Washington, DC and Cambridge,
Massachusetts and chapters in over a dozen metropolitan areas
across the nation.  For membership information, please

[Week ending July 26, 1992

========================== KEY ================================
The words after the numbers are a short PARAPHRASES of the
articles, or QUOTES from them, NOT AN OBJECTIVE SUMMARY and
not necessarily my opinion.
===============================================================

  [We need new guest (or regular) editors, for information send
   email to kadie@eff.org.  - Carl]

Notes 1 through 3 are about a Canadian journalist's articles on
Internet "pornography."

1. These are articles by Peter Moon of The Globe and Mail, Toronto.
The first is "Network Sex: Is increasingly explicit material on some
computer bulletin boards free speech, or obscenity." The second is
"Network lets users say what they think." Reprinted with permission.
    <1992Jul21.164722.252@jarvis.csri.toronto.edu>

2. If you're talking to the press, don't rely on estimates of Usenet
readerships. The real numbers are impossible to get, and anyway most
subscribers are "lurkers" and don't post at all. Any story about alt.
sex.bondage is likely to paint a needlessly dark picture of Usenet.
    <1992Jul22.001149.29524@clarinet.com>

3. Lurk factors are huge (one example shows 180 lurkers to 25 active
posters). Usenet newsgroups give shy persons an opportunity to listen
without imposing the expectation that they will participate.
    <711770390@romeo.cs.duke.edu>

Notes 4 through 6 discuss the witholding from children of alt.sex.*
and its relation to free speech and censorship.

4. All this talk about censorship of Usenet is insane. It's good not
to let children view sexually explicit material, but because people
who attend universities are of legal age that doesn't apply to Usenet.
If one is offended, one needn't continue to read or view the offensive
material.
    <1992Jul21.221517.8106@phlpa.pha.pa.us>

5. Note 4 seems to be drawing a possibly arbitrary line between
adults (who do have absolute freedom of speech) and children (who
don't?!?). By the way, some university students are in their early
teens which by the logic in note 4 would justify withdrawing
alt.sex.* from undergrads. ...Seems like censorship!
    <1992Jul22.175643.15218@cs.sfu.ca>

6. Allowing young children (age 7, for example) to access alt.sex.* is
reasonably analogous to allowing them access to adult bookstores. Just
as the laws excluding them from adult bookstores aren't censorship or
violations of first amendment rights, so is withholding alt.sex.* from
them not censorship.
    <1992Jul23.122034.28066@phlpa.pha.pa.us>

Note 7 is about child pornography law.

7. Can a computer-generated picture of sexual activity involving
children be considered child pornography? According to the relevant
U.S. statute, shipment/receipt of pornography involving children is
criminal only when the "visual depiction involves the use of a minor
engaging in sexually explicit conduct." A computer-rendered image
would not involve such use of a minor.
    <1992Jul25.113338.2310@panix.com>

Notes 8 through 11 are concerned with students placing in their
..plan files "cop killer" song lyrics. Notes 8 and 9 discuss the
economic case for universities permitting or prohibiting certain
activities. Note 10 discusses ethics and freedom and note 11
discusses the requirement that a University treat account holders
consistently.

8. A previous poster argued that a student paying fees at a university
may, by doing so, acquire certain rights to the use of the school's
computers. How much of the cost of those computers is paid for by the
fees, though? At some schools student fees pay for a proportionately
small part of the computer facilities. In other ways, too, the previous
poster is mistaking privileges for rights.
    <1992Jul20.193027.1585@rice.edu>

9. A university "is a company and you buy their product. This doesn't
give you a right to control their money, any more than "buying a Mars
bar gives you the right to control the candy company. "The only recourse
you have...is not to buy the product."
    

10. As long as nobody is forced to see the material in question, the
student should not be punished. Material in public access information
areas should be "PG-13." Other users should be able to "finger" anyone
"without getting any sort of shock."
    

11. Print out a session stamped with time and date in which you finger
a number of other users who you know to have questionable material in
their .plan files. Use this as evidence that the university is singling
you out unfairly and inconsistently if it requires YOU to remove from
your .plan file material it finds offensive. This makes the issue a
first amendment case that the university would likely lose.

These unreconstructed paleo-capitalists (no Karl, not you :)
really get on my kidneys.

Even *private* institutions of higher learning have a responsibility
to keep their fori open to even the most catholic discourse.
Ever hear of 'academic' freedom?   Ever notice how schools are .edu
and businesses .com?

As far as the hideously offensive .plan goes, I find it
an annoyance on the par with people shouting nonsense at you
on the way to cafeteria.  The net is a public place
and some people behave like boors (I include in this category the
collection of twits who reflexively respond to anything that
content control should belong to those who own the medium).

Perhaps a reasonable solution is to offer the sensitive fingerers
and plan-less finger - just the facts m'am.  It can't be very
hard to write a filter in perl to delete 'Plan:' and what follows
from the finger output.  As for me, I only shop (armed with three
letters of recommendation) at state accredited purveyors of Mars
bars and keep my .plan clean, so you don't have to wash your hands
after fingering.  OK, back to net.lurking.

I agree with you entirely that educational institutions have these
responsibilities.  I was responding, not to the particular claim, but
to the justification of that claim.

As a member of the community of an educational institution, one has
the right to academic freedom, not because one buys the product, but
because of the nature of the institution itself.

Indeed, part of the product that I buy *is* academic freedom. In the
contract between me and the University of Illinois (e.g. the student
code), the University explicitly promises to respect my freedom of
expression and privacy (even on University facilities). I think
this is typical of most such contracts/student codes.

Subject: Article 11--EFF releases analysis of FBI Digital Telephony (wiretap)
                     proposal

+=========+=================================================+===========+
|  F.Y.I. |Newsnote from the Electronic Frontier Foundation |Sep 17,1992|
+=========+=================================================+===========+

 JOINT INDUSTRY/PUBLIC INTEREST COALITION RELEASES WHITE PAPER OPPOSING
                   FBI DIGITAL TELEPHONY LEGISLATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), on behalf
of a coalition of industry, trade associations, computer users, and
privacy and consumer representatives, today released a white paper
entitled, "Analysis of the FBI Proposal Regarding Digital Telephony."
The FBI has proposed legislation which would require that all
telecommunications equipment be designed to allow law enforcement
monitoring and is seeking passage in the last few weeks of this
congress. The organizations that signed the paper believe that the
proposal would cost consumers millions of dollars, damage U.S.
competitiveness in the telecommunications marketplace, threaten national
security interests, and deny American consumers and American businesses
of much-wanted security and privacy on voice and data communications.

"Basically, the FBI's legislative proposal is premature.  We hope that
the white paper demonstrates that there are too many potential dangers
inherent in the legislative proposal and that there are other means of
addressing this situation," said Jerry Berman, Executive Director of the
Washington office of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

Over the past decade a host of new digital communication technologies
have been introduced and more are being developed. New telephone
services, such as call-forwarding and last number re-dial, are now being
offered.  The FBI is concerned about the impact these services -- and
other digital communications techniques -- will have on its ability to
wiretap. In the future, the vast majority of computer communications
will also use this technology to transfer information and documents.

Signatories included major telecommunications equipment manufacturers,
such as AT&T; computer manufacturers, such as IBM and Digital Equipment
Corporation; software producers, such as Microsoft and Lotus; network
providers, such as Prodigy and Advanced Network and Services, Inc.;
trade associations in the telecommunications, computer and electronic
mail businesses; and public interest groups, such as the Electronic
Frontier Foundation and the ACLU. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a
group of 955 members of the computer community, has been coordinating an
industry/public interest working group on digital telephony.

The working group has met with the FBI over a number of months in an
effort to work out mutually-agreeable solutions to the challenge that
the development of new communications technologies poses to the FBI.
David Johnson, a partner at Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, drafted the
white paper for the working group and serves as its legal advisor.

"We have made significant progress and both sides better understand the
other's needs and concerns. The bottom line, however, is that those who
signed the paper do not see broad-based legislation as the right
approach to this challenge. We have worked with the FBI to develop
practical, technical solutions to the problems they are anticipating and
intend to continue to do so," said John Podesta, of Podesta Associates,
Inc., who coordinates the working group on behalf of EFF.

Subject: Article 12--Defense Conversion Hearing

The Department of Defense has set up a Defense Conversion Commission,
which is traveling around the country to conduct hearings on local
conversion requirements.  So far there have been hearings in Atlanta;
Long Beach, California; St. Louis; Dallas; Groton, Connecticut; and
Seattle.  The public hearings last one day, and the commission also
visits sites of major defense contractors and speaks to the local press
about defense conversion.  The commission is scheduled to release a
report on its findings no later than December 31.

On September 24th, the commission held its hearing in Seattle and
testifying on behalf of CPSR and The 21st Century Project was Professor
Philip Bereano, professor of technology and public policy at the
University of Washington.  Phil spoke for ten minutes -- the alloted
time for each hearing witness -- about The 21st Century Project and its
program of democratizing U.S. technology policy and redirecting research
and development programs to peaceful and environmentally responsible
goals.

There were eighteen other hearing witnesses testifying, representing a
broad range of public interest and business organizations, including
Washington State SANE/Freeze, Seattle Women Act for Peace, and the
Washington Association of Churches.  Professional organizations
represented included the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees
Association and the IEEE Engineering Manpower Committee.  There was also
testimony from the King County Diversification Committee, the local
commission on economic conversion.

There are six members of the commission, most of them Pentagon
officials; there is one representative from the Department of Labor, and
one from the President's Council of Economic Advisers.  It is chaired by
David J. Berteau, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Production
and Logistics, and former director of the DoD's Office of Economic
Adjustment.  The representative from the Department of Labor (and the

Subject: Article 13--Genetic Infomation and Privacy

The New York Times reports today (9/29, page C2) that a survey
commissioned by the March of Dimes reveals that a majority of the people
surveyed do not consider genetic information to be exclusively private.
Respondents apparently said, in the majority, that information about
potential defects in a person's genetic makeup should be revealed not
only to spouses and other family members, but also to insurance
companies and employers.

The article says that the public appears "extremely optimistic" about
the prospects for gene therapy, or the ability to treat genetic
disorders with biotechnology.  Over 80 per cent of the respondents were
enthusiastic about the concept of gene therapy, although the article
notes that about 60 per cent admitted they knew nothing about it.

A little over 40 per cent of people surveyed said that they would
welcome the use of genetic alteration to "improve the physical
characteristics that children would inherit," or to improve
intelligence.  The article mentions that scientists attributed this
figure to the widely shared view that intelligence is an inherited
trait, although there is little evidence for this view, and no
identified gene for intelligence.

Fifty-eight per cent of the people interviewed believed that an insurer
has a right to know about genetic abnormalities, and 33 per cent
believed that an employer has the same right.

Only eight states have passed laws that prohibit discrimination against
people with abnormal results on a genetic test, and, the article says,
most of those are directed only at people with sickle cell anemia.

Subject: Article 14--Genetic Privacy (cont'd)

  Genetic Privacy (cont'd)

This is a short clarification of the message posted yesterday
about the March of Dimes survey on genetic privacy.  The survey
was described in a New York Times article that appeared on
September 2, 1992.

According to the Times article, 57% of the respondents said that
"someone other than a patient had a right to know that
the person had a genetic defect."  *Of that 57%,*  98% said
that a spouse or fiance had a right to know, 58% said an insurer
had a right to know, and 33% percent said an employer had
a right to know.

Of all respondents then, if asked whether someone other
than the patient has the right to know about genetic
defects, the numbers would be as follows:

            "Right to know about genetic defects?"

                          Yes    No
            Spouse/fiance     56    44
            Employer          33    67
            Insurer           19    81

These numbers do not appear to support the article's
conclusion that the majority of Americans support
widespread access to genetic information.

I contacted the Lou Harris organization this morning.
We should have a copy of the complete poll results
later this week.

Re:       Article 15--HR 5983, legislation to provide online access to
          federal information
          (Sucessor to Gateway/WINDO bills)

Date:     September 23, 1992, Washington, DC.

     On Wednesday, September 23, the House Administration
Committee unanimously approved H.R. 5983, the "Government
Printing Office (GPO) Electronic Information Access Enhancement
Act of 1992."  The bill, which had been introduced the day
before, was cosponsored by committee chairman Charlie Rose (D-
NC), ranking minority member William Thomas (R-CA) and Pat
Roberts (R-KA).  The measure was a watered down version of the
GPO Gateway/WINDO bills (S. 2813, HR 2772), which would provide
one-stop-shopping online access to hundreds of federal
information systems and databases.

     The new bill was the product of negotiations between
Representative Rose and the republican members of the House
Administration Committee, who had opposed the broader scope of
the Gateway/WINDO bills.  Early responses to the new bill are
mixed.  Supporters of the Gateway/WINDO bill were disappointed by
the narrower scope of the bill, but pleased that the legislation
retained the Gateway/WINDO policies on pricing of the service
(free use by depository libraries, prices equal to the
incremental cost of dissemination for everyone else).  On
balance, however, the new bill would substantially broaden public
access to federal information systems and databases, when
compared to the status quo.


     WHAT HR 5983 DOES

The bill that would require the Government Printing Office (GPO)
to provide public online access to:

     -    the Federal Register
     -    the Congressional Record
     -    an electronic directory of Federal public information
          stored electronically,
     -    other appropriate publications distributed by the
               Superintendent of Documents, and
     -    information under the control of other federal
               departments or agencies, when requested by the
               department or agency.

The Superintendent of Documents is also required to undertake a
feasibility study of further enhancing public access to federal
electronic information, including assessments the feasibility of:

     -    public access to existing federal information systems,
     -    the use of computer networks such as the Internet and
          NREN, and
     -    the development (with NIST and other agencies) of
          compatible standards for disseminating electronic
          information.

There will also be studies of the costs, cost savings, and
utility of the online systems that are developed, including an
independent study of GPO's services by GAO.


     WHAT HR 5983 DOESN'T DO

The new bill discarded the names WINDO or Gateway without a
replacement.  The new system is simply called "the system," a
seemingly minor change, but one designed to give the service a
lower profile.

A number of other features of the Gateway/WINDO legislation were
also lost.

-    While both S. 2813 and HR 2772 would have required GPO to
     provide online access through the Internet, the new bill
     only requires that GPO study the issue of Internet access.

-    The Gateway/WINDO bills would have given GPO broad authority
     to publish federal information online, but the new bill
     would restrict such authority to documents published by the
     Superintendent of Documents (A small subset of federal
     information stored electronically), or situations where the
     agency itself asked GPO to disseminate information stored in
     electronic formats.  This change gives agencies more
     discretion in deciding whether or not to allow GPO to
     provide online access to their databases, including those
     cases where agencies want to maintain control over databases
     for financial reasons (to make money off the data).

-    The republican minority insisted on removing language that
     would have explicitly allowed GPO to reimburse agencies for
     their costs in providing public access.  This is a
     potentially important issue, since many federal agencies
     will not work with GPO to provide public access to their own
     information systems, unless they are reimbursed for costs
     that they incur.  Thus, a major incentive for federal
     agencies was eliminated.

-    S. 2813 and HR 2772 would have required GPO to publish an
     annual report on the operation of  the Gateway/WINDO and
     accept and consider *annual* comments from users on a wide
     range of issues.  The new bill only makes a general
     requirement that GPO "consult" with users and data vendors.
     The annual notice requirement that was eliminated was
     designed to give citizens more say in how the service
     evolves, by creating a dynamic public record of citizen
     views on topics such as the product line, prices, standards
     and the quality of the service.  Given the poor record of
     many federal agencies in addressing user concerns, this is
     an important omission.

-    S. 2813 would have provided startup funding of $3 million in
     fy 92 and $10 million in fy 93.  The new bill doesn't
     include any appropriation at all, causing some observers to
     wonder how GPO will be able to develop the online
     Congressional Record, Federal Register, and directory of
     databases, as required by the bill.


     WHAT HAPPENED?

The bill which emerged from Committee on Wednesday substantially
reflected the viewpoints of the republicans on the House
Administration Committee.  The republican staffers who negotiated
the new bill worked closely with lobbyists for the Industry
Information Association (IIA), a trade group which represents
commercial data vendors, and who opposed the broader
dissemination mandates of the Gateway/WINDO bills.

Why did WINDO sponsor Charlie Rose, who is Chair of the House
Administration Committee, give up so much in the new bill?
Because Congress is about to adjourn, and it is difficult to pass
any controversial legislation at the end of a Congressional
session.  The failure to schedule earlier hearings or markups on
the WINDO legislation (due largely to bitter partisan battles
over the House bank and post office, October Surprise and
campaign financing reform) gave the republican minority on the
committee enormous clout, since they could (and did) threaten to
kill the bill.

Rose deserves credit, however, for being the first member of
congress to give the issue of citizen online access to federal
information systems and databases such high prominence, and his
promise to revisit the question next session is very encouraging.


     PROSPECTS FOR PASSAGE

The new bill has a long way to go.  It must be scheduled for a
floor vote in the House and a vote in the Senate.  The last step
will likely be the most difficult.  In the last few weeks of a
Congressional session, any member of the Senate can put a "hold"
on the bill, preventing it from receiving Senate approval this
year, thus killing the bill until next legislative session.  OMB
and the republican minority on the House Administration Committee
have both signed off on the bill, but commercial data vendors
would still like to kill the bill.  There's a catch, however.

Rose's staff has reportedly told the Information Industry
Association (IIA) that if it kills HR 5983, it will see an even
bolder bill next year.  Since IIA was an active participant in
the negotiations over the compromise bill, any effort to kill the
bill will likely antagonize Rose.  Of course, some observers
think that an individual firm, such as Congressional Quarterly,
may try to kill the bill.  Only time will tell.


     IS THE GLASS HALF EMPTY OR HALF FULL?

Despite the many changes that have weakened the bill, HR 5983 is
still an important step forward for those who want to broaden
public access to federal information systems and databases.  Not
only does the bill require GPO to create three important online
services (the directory, the Congressional Record and the Federal
Register), but it creates a vehicle that can do much more.
Moreover, HR 5983 would provide free online access for 1,400
federal depository libraries, and limit prices for everyone else
to the incremental cost of dissemination.  These pricing rules
are far superior to those used by NTIS, or line agencies like
NLM, who earn substantial profits on the sale of electronic
products and services.

5983, quickly, before Congress adjourns in October.  All members

So your saying that no-one on the XFree86 team wants to go to all the trouble
of signing the non-disclosure agreement, write the code, and then compile
it for each different platform that XFree86 will run on.  I can see that!
What a headache that would be.  Any chance that we can get a single volunteer

Just what are the tools to uncompile the object?  Are they talking about
machine level debuggers?  Do they mean that a machine level debugger cannot
be made availble in the same package as XFree86 code?  Or cannot be on the same
archive site?

That's why the ATMs manufactured by Citibank use a touchscreen with a
directional privacy filter (two pieces of 3M "window shade").  Unless a
tall person is standing over you, and quite close, it is very difficult to
see the contents of the screen.  Of course they could guess the key
positions, not too hard.  An attempt to thward this was tried; they randomized
the key positions for each customer transaction.  This proved too difficult
in customer tests and was abandoned.

Subject: Article 1--SEMATECH Campaign in NYT

The first page of the business section in The New York Times today
(October 5th) features an article on the work of the Campaign for
Responsible Technology on SEMATECH, the Austin, Texas, research
consortium.  The article is by John Markoff and is titled "Sematech's
New Mission Is Defined."  The first paragraph says:

        Congress took the unusual step over the weekend of mandating
        that 10 percent of the Sematech computer chip consortium's
        $100 million 1993 budget be used for environmental research.

This is not quite accurate, because SEMATECH's total budget is $200
million per year; the $100 million figure is the federal government's
contribution to the budget, of which $10 million is now dedicated to
environmental R&D.  And although it is true that $10 million is 10% of
$100 million, the legislation does not mandate 10%, which we suggested
as a standing recommendation for every annual authorization, but instead
only $10 million for FY 1993.

The article reports that the House language that earmarked the $10
million authorization that was a result of CRT work was retained in the
conference committee version of the Defense Authorization Bill finalized
this past weekend.

Ted Smith and Susana Almanza of CRT are quoted in the article.  Susana
is identified as the spokeswoman for People in Defense of the Earth and
its Resources, PODER, the environmental organization in East Austin that
grew out of the SEMATECH campaign.

Ted Smith, Susana Almanza, and CRT coordinator Rand Wilson are in Austin
today to hold a press conference and a meeting with the editorial board
of the Austin American-Statesman, the leading local newspaper.  The
newspaper has been mildly hostile to CRT work in the past, and generally
favors the semiconductor industry.

The passage of this authorization for SEMATECH is a major victory for
public interest activism in the United States.  To our knowledge, this
is the first time a public interest coalition has had a significant
impact on the research content of a major Pentagon-financed R&D
facility.  The work that has been done around SEMATECH can be used as a
model for democratic, participatory policymaking all over the country.
The organizers of this effort deserve thanks and congratulations from
everyone concerned about the character of democracy in the United
States.

To contact Ted Smith, chairman of the Campaign for Responsible
Technology, call (408) 287-6707, or write him on e-mail at
tsmith@igc.org.

To contact Susana Almanza, call her at the Texas Center for Policy
Studies, (512) 474-0811.

For more information about CRT and the SEMATECH campaign, contact Rand
Wilson at (617) 391-3866 or write him on e-mail at rwilson@igc.org.

I will also be happy to answer questions about the campaign.

Future tasks for the SEMATECH campaign include getting the consortium's
private partners to match the federal funds in order to generate another
$10 million in funding for environmental and labor safety R&D in FY 93,
and then to form public interest advisory committees to help PODER and
CRT activists monitor how SEMATECH spends the money it has been given by
Congress.  Please get in touch if you are interested in helping out with
either of these tasks.

Subject: Article 3--Call for SEMATECH Advisory Participants

Campaign for Responsible Technology
Sustainable Industry Policy Development at SEMATECH

ADVISORS NEEDED!

The semiconductor industry is often touted as a "clean" industry, but in
 fact uses some of the most dangerous materials in existence and has
been the source of unprecedented environmental degradation and workplace
 hazards. One of the major "footprints" of the industry's development
has been substantial groundwater contamination. Exposure to toxic
chemicals in the workplace and surrounding communities has been linked
to cancer, central nervous system damage, birth defects and deaths. CRT
and Southwest Network for Environmental and Economic Justice are
collaborating on an Electronics Industry Good Neighbor Campaign. Last
Summer, community organizations participated in a grass-roots assessment
 of the impact of the semiconductor industry on their communities that
confirmed widespread occupational and environmental problems. Further,
the assessment identified serious concerns about employment
discrimination and the uneven benefits of the industry's economic
development for the community.

Seeking to solutions for these problems, the Campaign for Responsible
Technology (CRT) successfully helped to amend the FY '93 congressional
funding re-authorizing SEMATECH to include $10 million for research on
environmentally safe manufacturing methods.

The groups are also asking SEMATECH's private sector partners*--thirteen
 of the largest semiconductor manufacturers in the U.S.--to match the
taxpayer's $10 million by similarly earmarking 10 percent of their
SEMATECH contribution for environmentally safe manufacturing methods.

That would create a $20 million research fund at SEMATECH that could
directly address the problems experienced by semiconductor workers and
the communities where the production facilities are located. The
challenge for CRT is to develop a well-conceived research agenda that
would fulfill this promise. CRT will initiate a "shadow advisory
committee" to develop a $20 million research agenda for SEMATECH and to
establish a "yard stick" that will influence SEMATECH officials on how
the money will be spent in fiscal year 1993. There are three components
to this committee:

1) A task force on environmentally responsible manufacturing in the
semiconductor industry;

2) A task force on community development, to ensure that   communities
chosen as the sites for new semiconductor fabrication plants, or
communities hoping to attract such   plants, can have expert advice on
how to manage the   development process to attain maximum community
benefit.

3) A task force on labor, to promote high skilled jobs and new forms of
work organization in the semiconductor industry.

Participants in the three advisory task forces will be drawn from CRT's
advisory board and other nationally recognized experts in these fields.
The task forces are will not seek to answer these questions on their
own. Rather, each would identify questions that SEMATECH researchers
should be asking in order to comply with the needs of CRT and the
Electronics Industry Good Neighbor Campaign's needs.

The three task forces will serve as guides for the research to be
conducted at SEMATECH; they will determine the most important research
questions and suggest qualified professionals who could competently help
 SEMATECH arrive at good policies.

The task forces will not deal directly with SEMATECH officials, but
serve as an expert resource for the grassroots organizers who have
conducted this campaign and who will continue to monitor SEMATECH's
performance.

CRT plans to organize a conference in early 1993 where each of the task
forces will present their findings to representatives of organizations
participating in the Electronics Industry Good Neighbor Campaign and or
members of the Southwest Network for Environmental and Economic Justice.


After evaluating the research design proposed by the task forces, CRT

Towards a Guide to Social Action for Computer Professionals

By Jeff Johnson, Chair, and Evelyn Pine, Managing Director,
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)

Introduction

   "Being a typical nerd programmer, it's always been comforting to believe
   that somehow whatever I was working on in the darkness of my cubicle
   would eventually benefit the world. ...  I focused on what was
   interesting to me, assuming that it would also be important to the
   world.  But the events in L.A. have forced me to think that maybe it
   doesn't work that way; and to confront the question:  what can I, as a
   professional in the HCI field, do to help change what's going on in the
   world?" -- a CHI'92 attendee.

The Rodney King video, trial, verdict, and subsequent riots jolted
Americans in many ways besides showing us acts of violence committed by
police and citizens.  It also made the inequities of American society
painfully clear, and provided a clear response to Langston Hughes'
question: "What happens to a dream deferred?"  Answer:  it explodes.
This caused many people to rethink how they are conducting their lives,
and how we are conducting our neighborhoods, our cities, our states,
and our nation.

Computer professionals have a relatively comfortable position in this
society.  For the most part, we are well-paid, and our jobs are more
secure than most.  As a result, we live in nicer neighborhoods, send
our kids to better schools, eat healthier food, use better tools, and
have access to better health care.  Because of this, some of us feel a
responsibility to help those in our society who aren't so well-off, and
some of us don't.

However, computer professionals are not just another well-paid segment
of society.  We, more than people in most other lines of work, create
world-changing technology, technology that profoundly affects how
people live, work, and die.  We can create technology that, e.g., can
be used to improve neighborhoods, education, food production and
distribution, tools, and health care.  We can also create technology
that can be used to keep the poor out of our neighborhoods and schools,
produce and sell junk food and worthless tools, and limit access to
health care, as well as keep the lid on discontent and even kill people
more efficiently.

Computer technology can help reduce inequity and it can also help
exacerbate it.  The public learned of the King beating because of
technology in the hands of citizens.  Today anyone with a PC, an
ink-jet printer, and a copier can produce documents that political
activists of just thirty years ago, cranking out smelly typewritten
ditto copies, never imagined.  Citizens of China and Thailand used fax,
video, and electronic mail to document government repression of
democratic movements.  Computer technology is a crucial ingredient of
all of the above, in their design and manufacture as well as in the
tools themselves.

Unfortunately, the effect of introducing computer technology has more
often been to increase the stratification of society.  Let's face it:
computer systems often lead to loss of jobs.  Furthermore, as the
infrastructure upon which society is based becomes more dependent upon
computer technology, those without technical skills are left behind.
The end of the Cold War and the recession, combined with the
introduction of computer technology, have served to exacerbate
joblessness and hopelessness for those who have been rendered
superfluous and don't have the education to become "knowledge workers."

   "How many of the projects that are funded will have a net result of
   reducing jobs -- particularly jobs for less-educated people?  ...
   I find many in the computer industry have defensive rationalizations
   for the fact that their own labor will result in the loss of jobs to
   society.  ...  The up and coming area of software that I myself work
   in -- workflow -- will automate people out of work. ...  How do we
   deal with this?" -- A CHI'92 attendee.

This special relationship between computer technology and society gives
those who develop it -- us -- responsibilities beyond any that arise
merely from our comfortable economic status.  To quote from the
statement of purpose of Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility (CPSR):  "Decisions regarding the development and use of
computers ... have far-reaching consequences and reflect basic values
and priorities.  We believe that computer technology should make life
more enjoyable, productive, and secure."

The King riots jolted us, causing many of us to reflect on whether we
are living up to our responsibilities as citizens and as computer
professionals.  The contrast between the world we inhabit, of which the
CHI'92 conference is a part, and the one that exploded into violence
and flames the week before the conference, caused some of us to feel a
certain alienation from our work, as the opening quotation of this
article illustrates.  Are we part of the solution, or part of the
problem?  Also, as the effects of the riots rapidly spread to
surrounding neighborhoods, other cities, and even the presidential
campaign, it became obvious that the two "worlds" aren't really
separate.  That burning society we saw on TV wasn't someone else's,
it was ours.

What Can I Do? -- The CPSR/CHI'92 "Social Issues" Session

In the midst of the worst period of rioting, as many of us were
preparing to head to Monterey, the site of CHI'92, Prof. Chris Borgman
of U.C.L.A. sent an e-mail message to several of her acquaintances
across the country, describing what was going on in L.A. and how she
and her friends there felt about it (see Shneiderman, 1992).  Prof. Ben
Shneiderman was especially touched by the message.  He contacted the
CHI'92 Co-Chairs, Jim Miller and Scooter Morris, and expressed his
desire that the conference should not run its course without
acknowledging the riots and the events that led up to them.  Even
though the riots were not directly CHI- or computer-related, he felt
that ignoring them constituted burying our heads in the sand, and would
be morally wrong.  Jim and Scooter agreed that something should be
done, but of course by that point the conference schedule was set.
They suggested a special session, during the lunch break just after the
official opening plenary session on Tuesday.  Jim also suggested that
CPSR Chair Jeff Johnson be invited to help plan the session.

On Monday evening, Ben and Jeff met to plan the session.  What quickly
emerged was a desire not only to acknowledge the distressing external
events and give people a chance to vent their spleens, but also to help
give people the wherewithal to act.  To Ben and Jeff, it seemed that
many of their colleagues were angry, upset, worried, or frightened
about what was going on, but didn't know what to do about it, or even
how to find out.  They decided that the session should be an
opportunity for people to share ideas on how computer professionals,
their employers, and their professional societies can help address
social problems of the sort that led to the riots.  Jeff proposed that
to facilitate the capture and sharing of ideas, session attendees be
asked to submit ideas on paper as well as presenting them verbally.
CPSR volunteered to collect and compile the responses and issue a
report back to the attendees.  Later that night, he created a form for
action-ideas, labeled "Constructive Responses to Events in L.A. and
Elsewhere," and made about 60 copies to cover the expected audience.

The next morning, at the opening plenary session, Jim Miller announced
the special session.  This was the first that the approximately 2500
attendees at CHI had heard of it.

At the announced time, despite the late notice and the conflict with
lunch, approximately 300 people showed up.  Student volunteers quickly
went to make more copies of the "Constructive Responses..." form.  Ben
Shneiderman expressed his delight at the number of people who had come
and opened the session, describing his feelings about the riots,
reading Chris Borgman's e-mail message, and giving the intent of the
session.  Prof. Borgman then spoke, elaborating on her message and
giving her ideas about what people might do.  She was followed by Jeff
Johnson, who talked about growing up in South Central L.A., what it is
like for his relatives who live there now, and about CPSR and some of its
 programs.

Members of the audience were then invited to the microphone to share
their ideas about what can be done to resolve social inequities.  At
first, people were hesitant to speak, but within fifteen minutes or so
there were more people waiting to speak than there was time for.  Some
people described volunteer work they do, some named organizations they
support, some talked about what companies do or should do, and some
talked about what various government bodies should be, but aren't, doing.

Beyond CHI'92

One hundred and ten members of the audience wrote suggestions on the
forms and turned them in.  After the conference, CPSR began the process
of compiling the responses and producing the promised report.  We found
volunteers to put the responses on-line.  We created an e-mail
distribution list consisting of respondents who had provided e-mail
addresses.  We took a quick pass through the data, to see if it
contained ideas worth publishing and sharing.  It did.

On the basis of our initial look at the responses, the report began to
take shape in our minds.  We didn't think it would suffice to simply
list all of the ideas that the session attendees had written.  A quick
query sent to the e-mail list confirmed this:  session participants
didn't want the raw data or even lightly-digested data; they wanted a
well-digested, well-organized guide to social action, a resource
booklet that goes beyond what people put on their response forms.  Not
everyone has been a volunteer or activist, and even those of us who
have can benefit from a complete guidebook on how to make a positive
contribution to society.

Producing such a comprehensive report presented CPSR with a challenge,
for it would require a significant amount of work.  For instance, many
respondents mentioned organizations, but it was up to us to provide
contact addresses.  We also found some suggestions to be out-of-date,
e.g., organizations that have changed policies.  The research necessary
to produce such a report in the months following CHI'92 exceeds what
CPSR's small staff and volunteer-base can deliver.  To produce the full
report would require funding to allow us to pay for some of the labor.
We made some initial efforts to get funding, so far without success.
Nonetheless, we were committed to producing a timely report for the
CHI'92 session attendees.  With encouragement from Ben Shneiderman, the
two of us decided to write a brief version of the report for SIGCHI
Bulletin.  Hopefully, this brief initial report will help attract
funding for a full report.

This report is therefore intended to be the first deliverable of a
possible new CPSR project that would, if funded, provide computer
professionals with information and guidance on how to become "part of
the solution" to pressing social problems.  Depending upon funding,
subsequent deliverables may include:

  - a moderated e-mail discussion list on social involvement,
  - an e-mail archive/server for information on social involvement,
  - the aforementioned booklet:  "A Guide to Social Action" for
computer professionals, suitable for companies to distribute to
employees, containing an overview of the ways to get involved, a
categorized list of ideas, a directory of organizations, some success
examples, with a sprinkling of interesting quotes from attendees of the
CHI'92 special session.
  - a clearinghouse service to help computer professionals and
companies down the road toward social involvement.

In this initial report, we chose to focus on a few of the
most-commonly-suggested ideas, rather than present a shallow overview
of all of them.  A more complete list will have to wait until the
booklet.  We begin with some comments on what we have learned from this
exercise, then summarize a few of the suggestions, and conclude.

What have we learned from this?

   "Tell me how I can help." -- a CHI'92 attendee.

Despite the stereotype of the apolitical, work-obsessed nerd, computer
professionals do care about what goes on in the world.  Many are
already involved in volunteer projects, political action, and
critically examining the impact of their work.  More importantly, many
more are looking for ways to get involved.  The King riots really shook
up a lot of people.

The respondents see potential in themselves, their companies, and their
professional associations, but are concerned that social issues often
get lost in the shuffle of busy people and companies.

CHI conference attendees may not be representative of computer
professionals in general.  Their professional focus on the interaction
between people and machines may make them more likely to be concerned
about social issues.  However, CPSR members nationwide -- who are not
predominantly CHI members -- have been proving for over a decade that a
computer career and interest in social issues are not mutually exclusive.

There is no shortage of good ideas about how to get involved.  The
hundred and ten respondents in the CPSR-CHI special session have
provided a first glimpse, but our feeling is that many more good ideas
remain to be suggested.

Many individuals, organizations, and companies are already doing things
that we can learn from.  We needn't design from scratch.

Summary of Responses

   "Education is the single most effective and powerful way to change
   the situation in a permanent way." -- a CHI'92 attendee.

Our respondents overwhelmingly saw education as fundamental.  They
believe that individuals, companies, professional societies, and
various levels of government could be doing much more to support
education than they now are.  For example:

  - Individuals can tutor disadvantaged kids, teach computer courses or
run computer labs in schools, and speak in schools about their company
and their work.
  - Companies can adopt a school, donate equipment and software, and
establish programs in which students visit the workplace to learn what
computer professionals do and what skills they need.
  - Professional societies can provide scholarships for high school
kids, encourage individuals and companies to develop education
applications of computer technology, and advocate greater public
funding of education.

Many respondents suggested that individuals and companies donate new
and used computer equipment to schools, community centers, and
non-profit organizations.  However, some pointed out that giving
antiquated, unreliable, or inappropriate equipment is almost worse than
unhelpful, in that it can drain valuable time and energy from the
important work that these organizations do.  Accordingly, many
non-profits will not accept equipment for which they can no longer find
software, documentation, and maintenance support.  To help insure that
donated equipment is effectively used, computer professionals can
donate time and expertise.  Otherwise, donated equipment may just sit in a
 corner.

Not surprisingly, volunteerism is strongly advocated by our
respondents.  Some of their suggestions are:

  - Individuals can volunteer in computer labs, get involved with a
organizations that link volunteers with non-profit groups (e.g.,
CompuMentor), or even teach reading in an urban library.  A frequent
comment was that literacy is more important than computer literacy.
  - Companies can encourage volunteerism by helping match willing
employees with worthy organizations, by allowing employees to share
their skills on company time, and by honoring employees' volunteer efforts.
  - Professional societies can encourage volunteerism among
professionals by developing mentor programs in which members work with
urban youth, and by developing computer curricula that professionals
can take into volunteer teaching situations.

   "I read to primary students one-half hour per week.  I get more out of
   that time than the kids, but their focus on me tells me they are
   getting a lot out of my time also." -- a CHI'92 attendee.

Several respondents who are involved in volunteer work noted that
volunteering has value far beyond that of the actual work that
volunteers do.  It helps build much-needed understanding and trust
between ethnic and socioeconomic groups.  It also is beneficial to the
volunteers themselves:  they gain teaching experience, social skills,
and a broader perspective on the society in which they live, and often
have fun while doing it.

Computer professionals have learned that access to on-line
communication and information services is a powerful tool for their own
education, communication, and activism.  We found that many of them
believe that on-line access would be just as empowering for the public
at large.  Middle-class Americans are already beginning to get on-line,
but individuals, companies, and professional societies can make an
extra effort to assure that the poor are not cut out of the loop.
Individuals, companies, and professional societies can help put
communities on-line, as has been done in Berkeley (Community Memory
Project) and Santa Monica (Public Education Network).  Such networks
can facilitate communication and discussion not only with other
citizens of a local community, but, depending on how they are connected
to larger networks, with information service providers and even elected
representatives.

   "Companies can actively recruit blacks and other minorities.  I have
   been at CHI for 2 1/2 days and have seen only two blacks with CHI
   name tags." -- a CHI'92 attendee.

More of a commitment to affirmative action in hiring and promotion is
seen as a major way in which companies can help overcome social
inequities.  This means making an extra effort to find qualified
minorities and women to fill jobs, and, when candidates are equally
qualified (i.e., the difference in their estimated ability to perform
the job is less than the margin of error of the assessment process),
giving the benefit of the doubt to minorities and women.  Some
respondents suggested, for example, that companies hold outreach
activities in poor communities to find potential employees.

The respondents recommended awards as a way to encourage computer
companies, academic research projects, and individuals to get involved.
 Each year, CPSR recognizes a computer scientist who, in addition to
making important contributions to the field, has demonstrated an
ongoing commitment to working for social change.  (ACM activist and IBM
researcher Barbara Simons is CPSR's 1992 Norbert Wiener Award winner.)
Many respondents suggested that SIGCHI or ACM offer an award for
companies that demonstrate a similar commitment through community
projects, encouraging employee volunteerism, or other good works.

The CHI conference itself emerged as an important potential focus of
social action work.  Respondents recommended that CHI organizers seek
ways to have a positive impact upon the host community.  Local students
-- high-school and college -- could be given tours of exhibits or
scholarships to attend the conference.  Equipment used at the
conference could be donated to local schools and organizations.
Respondents also suggested paper and poster sessions devoted to
applying technology to social problems or to understanding social
issues related to computer technology.

   "What's underneath are not wounds, but faults -- lines of fracture, of
   discontinuity, in society, which periodically relieve their stress in
   these violent ways.  What can we do about that?" -- a CHI'92 attendee.

Although our respondents provided a wealth of ideas for how we, as
computer professionals and concerned citizens, can offer our time and
skills for the betterment of society, a number of them acknowledged
that charity, volunteering, and technology alone cannot solve political
and social problems.  Closing the gap between rich and poor, educated
and illiterate, empowered and disenfranchised will require changes in
basic priorities at the local, state, national, and international
levels.  Accordingly, many respondents recommended attempting to
influence the political process, either individually, through
professional associations, or through organizations like CPSR.

Conclusions

   "Thanks for the noontime meeting on Tuesday!  It was motivating to see
   such a strong response." -- a CHI'92 attendee.

   "Thank you, thank you, thank you for organizing this forum and bringing
   some heart and spirit into this cold, albeit exciting, environment.
   Onwards and upwards, I'm with you all the way!" -- a CHI'92 attendee.

   "What a wonderful experience to find a humanistic island at a
   professional conference!" -- a CHI'92 attendee.

The unexpectedly large response to the noontime session at CHI'92 was
extremely gratifying.  Also gratifying is the degree of concern that
members of the CHI community have about social inequities and the
seriousness with which they addressed themselves to overcoming them.
Hopefully, with this report as inspiration, many computer professionals
will begin to take action.

   "I'll go back and start asking questions in my company." -- a CHI'92
   attendee.

The foregoing has only scratched the surface of the ideas that emerged
from the CHI'92 social issues session.  As described above, CPSR hopes
to expand this report into a widely-circulated Social Action Guide, and
eventually provide on-line services to help computer professionals take
action.

Subject: Article 6--Beta testers needed for security tool

Announcing the pending availability of

         Tripwire: A Unix File Integrity Checker

    This message is being posted to various newsgroups and mailing
lists to gather a group of beta-testers for a new security tool called
Tripwire.  Tripwire was written by Gene Kim, currently at Purdue
University, under the direction of Professor Gene Spafford.

    Tripwire should be of significant interest to system
administrators concerned about timely detection of system file
tampering on their Unix hosts.


Goal of Tripwire:
=================

    With the advent of increasingly sophisticated and subtle
account break-ins on Unix systems, the need for tools to aid the
detection of unauthorized modification of files becomes clear.
Tripwire is a tool that aids system administrators and users in
monitoring a designated set of files for any changes.  Used with
system files on a regular basis, Tripwire can notify system
administrators of corrupted or tampered files, so damage control
measures can be taken in a timely manner.

    Tripwire is a system file integrity checker, a utility that
compares a designated set of files and directories against
information stored in a previously generated database.  Any
differences are flagged and logged, and optionally, a user is
notified through mail.  When run against system files on a
regular basis, changes in critical system files would be spotted
at the next time-interval when Tripwire is run, so damage
control measures may be implemented immediately.  With
Tripwire, system administrators can conclude with a high degree
of certainty that a given set of files remain untouched from
unauthorized modifications, provided the program and database are
appropriately protected (e.g., stored on read-only disk).

    Tripwire uses message digest algorithms (cryptographic
checksums) to detect changes in a hard-to-spoof manner.  This
should be able to detect significant changes to critical files,
including those caused by insertion of backdoors or viruses.  It
also monitors changes to file permissions, modification times,
and other significant changes to inodes as selected by the system
administrator on a per-file/directory basis.

What we need:
=============

    As of this writing, Tripwire runs successfully on both BSD
and System V variants of Unix.  Among the operating systems
Tripwire has run on are:

    SunOS 5.x (SVR4)
    SunOS 4.x (BSD 4.3)
    Dynix 3.x (BSD 4.2)

    Compiling Tripwire should be as simple as editing the config.h
file to set the appropriate #defines, and typing 'make'.

    A pool of beta-testers is needed to ensure that Tripwire
works predictably on a wide variety of systems.  Of particular
interest are system administrators using the following operating
systems:

    AIX
    AUX
    BSD4.4
    HP/UX
    Mach
    NextOS
    OSF/1
    SVR3.x
    Ultrix
    Unicos
    Xenix
    System III
    Versions 6, 7, 8, & 9  :-)
    other versions we didn't list

    A config.h file allows you to tailor Tripwire around your
system specifics, such as the locations of system utilities (like
sort and diff), and desired lookup pathnames to your Tripwire
database files.

    Possible porting trouble-spots are generally restricted to
dirent(S5)/direct(BSD) funkiness and #defines that changed for
POSIX compliance (such as those in  for stat.st_mode).

    Hopefully the process of beta-testing will highlight any
problems before any widely-released distribution.  It is also
hoped that reasonable system defaults for a wide variety of
systems can be gathered from a diverse set of beta-testers.
This would allow useful plug-and-play builds for the majority of
Tripwire users.


What you'd get as a beta-tester:
================================

    The entire source to Tripwire, manual pages, a README, and
the Tripwire design document.


What you'd need to do:
======================

    You will need to install the code on your system and run
it.  You will need to report back any bugfixes, enhancements,
optimizations or other code-diddling that you believe useful.  If
you build a configuration file for a new system, you will need
to send this back.  You will have to collect some performance
data.  You will need to provide some honest, critical feedback on
utility, clarity, documentation, etc.

    You will need to do all this by about October 21.


Are you interested?
===================

    If so, please fill out the form at the end of this message, and
send it to (genek@mentor.cc.purdue.edu).  We will only take two or
three respondents for each system type for the beta test.

    Please allow some time for processing and selection of
beta-testers.  I promise to reply to all requests as
expeditiously as possible.

    A formal release of Tripwire is planned for sometime in
November.  Watch this space for details!

Subject: Linux 0.98.1 Information

finger torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi

                     Free UN*X for the 386

The current version of linux is a 0.98.1, released 92.10.04.  There are
various rootdisks that work with the newer versions, although some of
them have problems.  A new SLS release is expected soonish, using either
a 0.97.pl6 or 0.98.1 kernel release.

0.98.1 supports X11r5 and the new gcc-2.1 (and newer) libraries with
multiple shared libs - as well as any old binaries (except the 0.12
version of gdb which used the older ptrace() interface).  It also
contains support for debugging (core-dumping and attach/detach) as well
as profiling: use gcc-2.2.2d for full utilization of all these features.

Linux can be gotten by anonymous ftp from 'nic.funet.fi' (128.214.6.100)
in the directory '/pub/OS/Linux'.  This directory structure contains all
the linux OS- and library-sources, and enough binaries to get going.  To
install linux you still need to know something about unices: it's
relatively straightforward to install, but the documentation sucks raw
eggs, and people with no previous unix experience are going to get very
confused.

There are now a lot of other sites keeping linux archives.  The main
ones (as well as the above-mentioned nic.funet.fi) are:
  tsx-11.mit.edu (18.172.1.2):
    directory /pub/linux
  sunsite.unc.edu (152.2.22.81):
    directory /pub/Linux

(and many additional sites: there are now sites in the uk, japan etc
that carry linux, but I have lost count)

There is also a mailing list set up 'Linux-activists@niksula.hut.fi'.
To join, mail a request to 'Linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi'.
It's no use mailing me: I have no actual contact with the mailing-list
(other than being on it, naturally).

There is also a newsgroup that contain linux-related questions and
information: comp.os.linux.

Ok, well after I got my computer connected with UUCP (I'm still not a
registered system but soon I expect to register with the local UUCP stuff
and also get a domain name in mi.org) I tried to subscribe to the aotd list
with my account on my machine (aotnet) but I couldin't. It turned out, because
we put some more security from people using the mailing list, that mike
also accidentaly changed the list name. Well this is fixed now. To subscribe to
Art of Technology Digest, do *exactly* this:

mail mailserv@batpad.lgb.ca.us
Leave the Subject: line blank
Put this in the text of your message: SUBSCRIBE aotd

and you will be put on the mailing list. You should wait 1-24 hours for a
response. I am not using my computer as the mailserver because I only have a
2400 baud (or bps, whatever you like) modem and no mailserver software. Oh,
one more thing, you can get back issues of AoT-D from wuarchive.wustl.edu
under directory: /pub/aot/. Enjoy!
